## 2026-07-28 — Tier-1 baseline hardening (J100/J50 Run-2 workflow)

### Objective
Make the repository more workable first (Tier 1), using the authoritative Run-2 workflow:

- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Baseline workflow/repo audit completed**
   - Confirmed the authoritative scripts are present and tracked.
   - Confirmed required Run-2 input ROOT files exist:
     - `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J100_dataAll.root`
     - `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J50_dataAll.root`
   - Confirmed reference artifacts are present under `tests/references/`.

2. **`scripts/quality_check.py` strengthened with Tier-1 baseline checks**
   - Added required path validation for critical workflow files and reference artifacts.
   - Added optional workflow hint checks (non-fatal) for setup helpers.
   - Added explicit Python tool availability checks for:
     - `pytest`
     - `ruff`
     - `black`
   - Improved failure mode to be actionable (clear install guidance), rather than failing with opaque import/runtime errors.

3. **`doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` rewritten to match authoritative workflow**
   - Updated documentation focus from legacy/general flow to J100/J50 Run-2 execution.
   - Added Tier-1 baseline checklist aligned with `quality_check.py`.
   - Clarified scope boundaries and current known limitation:
     - `python/analysis_reference.py` still contains legacy fallback directory discovery (`run_135_1000_*`) and has not yet been fully migrated to prefer J100/J50 outputs first.

### Verification performed

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/quality_check.py`
  - Result: **success** (`syntax_ok`)
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`
  - Result: **12 passed**
- `python3 scripts/quality_check.py`
  - Result: expected environment failure message indicating missing `ruff` and `black` with install guidance.

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Pending: add environment pinning artifact (`requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`).
- Pending: migrate/extend `python/analysis_reference.py` to prioritize J100/J50 outputs.
- Pending: refresh frozen references/tests if migration changes output discovery.
- Pending: rerun full quality gate once lint/format tools are available in the active environment.

### Process note

From this point onward, each substantial activity will append a new dated section to this file summarizing:

- what changed,
- why it changed,
- how it was verified,
- and what remains.

## 2026-07-28 — Tier-1 completion planning + scope lock (background-only first)

### Objective
Capture the substantial Tier-1 planning and verification work completed after baseline hardening, while keeping the repo-workable-first constraint and authoritative Run-2 J100/J50 workflow fixed.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Tier-1 completion scope was clarified and locked with the user**
   - Confirmed execution priority remains strict Tier order: Tier 1 -> Tier 4.
   - Confirmed authoritative workflow remains:
     - `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
     - `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`
   - Confirmed delivery scope decision for current Tier-1 completion work:
     - **Background-only J100/J50 first**
     - **CLs workflow as a later Tier-1 extension**

2. **Repository/runtime evidence gathering for Tier-1 migration was completed**
   - Reviewed `python/analysis_reference.py` and confirmed legacy fallback discovery still targets `run/fits/...run_135_1000_(six|seven)Par` patterns.
   - Reviewed `tests/test_analysis_reference.py` and confirmed existing fixtures/assertions are still centered on legacy sixPar paths.
   - Inspected existing Run-2 outputs under:
     - `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/...`
     - `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/...`
   - Read J100 background-only quickFit log to establish current numerical/convergence behavior context before tightening regression criteria.

3. **Tier-1 implementation/testing plan prepared for next execution phase**
   - Planned migration of golden-master discovery and tests toward deterministic J100/J50-first behavior.
   - Planned preservation of tolerance-aware comparisons to protect against benign fit-level numeric jitter.
   - Planned separation of fast checks vs heavier/full checks as part of Tier-1 gate maturation.

### Verification performed

- Verified current activity log coverage by re-reading `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` before appending this entry.
- Verified the planning basis against current repository files and existing run artifacts (no contradictory evidence found).

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Pending: add environment pinning artifact (`requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`).
- Pending: migrate `python/analysis_reference.py` to deterministic J100/J50-first discovery for background-only outputs.
- Pending: update tests/references to match J100/J50-first behavior.
- Pending: formalize tolerance checks where needed for stable regression assertions.
- Pending: complete fast-vs-full Tier-1 gate split and document usage.

### Process note

- User instruction reaffirmed and adopted as an ongoing rule:
  - "please be sure to add all changes to the acvitvity log"
- Going forward, every substantial repository or workflow change will be appended here as a new dated section.

---

## 2026-07-29 — Activity-log correction: explicit titled section added

### Objective
Correct the missing titled entry for the latest work record and keep this log compliant with the rule to append substantial changes as dated sections.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Confirmed missing titled update section**
   - Re-read `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` and verified no new dated section existed beyond the two 2026-07-28 entries.

2. **Added an explicit titled dated section**
   - Appended this 2026-07-29 section so the most recent correction is clearly identifiable by title and date.

### Verification performed

- Re-read `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` after editing and confirmed this header is present:
  - `## 2026-07-29 — Activity-log correction: explicit titled section added`

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Pending: complete and verify the actual Tier-1 implementation deliverables (tests, environment pinning, quality-gate evolution) with concrete command outputs and file diffs.
- Pending: continue appending each substantial change as a new dated section in this log.

---

## 2026-07-29 — Tier-1 completion: provenance artifact + fast/full gate verification

### Objective
Complete the remaining Tier-1 implementation items for the authoritative J100/J50 Run-2 baseline by:

- recording environment provenance/pinning evidence,
- aligning Tier-1 system documentation with implemented behavior,
- executing and recording verification commands,
- preserving background-only-first scope with CLs deferred.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Environment provenance/pinning artifact added**
   - Added `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`.
   - Recorded runtime and tooling evidence captured from bounded probes:
     - `python_executable = /usr/bin/python3`
     - `python_version = 3.9.25`
     - `pyproject requires-python = >=3.11`
     - `pytest = 8.4.2`, `ruff = missing`, `black = missing`
     - `root-config --version = 6.40.02`
     - `ROOT` module discoverability present
     - prior bounded PyROOT probe evidence: RooFit available
   - Recorded authoritative path checks for J100/J50 background-only logs and optional `BHresults.json` absence.

2. **Tier-1 system documentation updated to current implementation**
   - Updated `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` to reflect real quality-gate usage:
     - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode fast`
     - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
   - Documented explicit fast/full semantics and their dependency checks.
   - Updated `python/analysis_reference.py` description to current deterministic J100/J50 background-only behavior.
   - Linked `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` from the system document.
   - Kept scope boundary explicit: CLs remains a follow-up extension.

3. **Tier-1 verification command sequence executed and captured**
   - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/quality_check.py`
     - Result: success (`__RC_PYCOMPILE__=0`)
   - `python3 -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`
     - Result: success (`13 passed`, `__RC_PYTEST__=0`)
   - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode fast`
     - Result: success (`13 passed`, `__RC_FAST__=0`)
   - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
     - Result: expected actionable tooling failure (`__RC_FULL__=2`) due to missing `ruff`/`black`, with install guidance emitted by the script.

### Troubleshooting/process notes

- Direct PyROOT import probes intermittently exceeded command timeout bounds in this environment.
- To avoid blocking Tier-1 completion, provenance evidence was gathered through bounded checks (`root-config`, module discoverability, prior successful bounded probe results) and documented transparently.

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Tier-1 documentation/provenance and gate verification are now recorded.
- Remaining operational environment gap: active interpreter/runtime tooling still does not satisfy full lint/format stack (`ruff`, `black`) and is below declared Python baseline (`>=3.11`).
- CLs integration remains intentionally deferred per background-only-first scope.

---

## 2026-07-29 — Tier-1 system documentation expansion implemented

### Objective
Implement the planned expansion of `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` so Tier-1 users have a complete, implementation-aligned operating guide for the authoritative J100/J50 Run-2 baseline.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Expanded Tier-1 system guide to cover end-to-end user operations**
   - Reworked `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` into a structured guide with:
     - purpose/audience/status,
     - Tier-1 goals and success criteria,
     - authoritative workflow/data surface,
     - Tier-1 repository map,
     - explicit quality-gate behavior (`--mode fast|full`, required paths, optional hints, exit semantics),
     - analysis-reference contract and schema expectations,
     - operating procedures, troubleshooting, reproducibility, and scope boundaries.

2. **Aligned documentation to source-of-truth implementation details**
   - Verified alignment to:
     - `scripts/quality_check.py` for required paths, optional hint paths, mode behavior, and tooling checks.
     - `python/analysis_reference.py` for workflow fit directories, log-selection behavior, supported fit-parameter names, and required payload keys.
     - `tests/references/analysis_reference.json` for current frozen baseline semantics (`J100`/`J50`, `cls_limit_points: []`, `p_bh: null`, `p_chi2: null`).

### Verification performed

- Consistency probe command (Python import/readback of Tier-1 constants + frozen reference keys)
  - Result: documentation-critical values matched implementation/reference data.
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`
  - Result: **13 passed**.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`
  - Result: no trailing whitespace (`__TRAILING_WS__=none`).

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Tier-1 system documentation expansion is complete and verified against current code/reference behavior.
- Remaining environment gap is unchanged: active runtime still lacks `ruff`/`black` and is below declared Python baseline (`>=3.11`) for full-mode parity.
- CLs integration remains intentionally deferred per background-only-first scope.

## 2026-07-30 — Tier-2 Python quality tooling and formatting baseline

### Objective

Establish a supported, reproducible project-local Python environment and enable
the complete pytest, Ruff, and Black quality-gate workflow.

### Substantial changes completed

- Recreated the repository-local virtual environment using Python 3.12.13.
- Installed pytest, Ruff, and Black into the same active interpreter environment.
- Added explicit development dependency records:
  - `requirements-dev.txt`
  - `requirements-dev-lock.txt`
- Added Git ignore exceptions so the development dependency records are
  intentionally version-controlled despite the repository-wide `*.txt` rule.
- Applied Ruff's safe automatic fixes to the explicit Tier-1 source and test targets.
- Applied Black formatting to the explicit Tier-1 source and test targets.
- Preserved unrelated working-tree content outside the Tier-2 staged changes.

### Environment evidence

- Python: `Python 3.12.13`
- Python executable: `/afs/cern.ch/user/h/hhook/FrequentistFramework/.venv/bin/python`
- pytest: `pytest 9.1.1`
- Ruff: `ruff 0.16.0`
- Black: `python -m black, 26.5.1 (compiled: yes)`

### Verification performed

- Command:
  `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
- Full quality-gate status: **success**
- Full quality-gate exit code: **0**
- Complete command output captured temporarily at:
  `/tmp/frequentist_framework_tier2_full_gate.log`

### Current status / remaining items

- Verify that the development environment can be recreated from requirements-dev-lock.txt.
- Continue recording substantial Tier-2 changes as new dated sections.

### 2026-07-30 — Tier-2 completion status and remaining work

#### Objective

Consolidate the Tier-2 environment, dependency, formatting, verification, and Git-integration work completed to date, and define the remaining acceptance criteria required before Tier 2 can be marked complete.

#### Significant work completed

- Established a repository-local virtual environment using Python 3.12.13, satisfying the declared Python 3.11-or-newer project requirement.
- Installed the quality-tooling stack into the same active environment:
  - pytest 9.1.1
  - Ruff 0.16.0
  - Black 26.5.1
- Added version-controlled development dependency records:
  - `requirements-dev.txt`
  - `requirements-dev-lock.txt`
- Added `.gitignore` exceptions for the dependency records because the repository otherwise ignores files matching `*.txt`.
- Applied Ruff's safe fixes for import ordering and missing final newlines.
- Applied Black formatting to the explicit Tier-1 source and test targets.
- Resolved all previously reported Ruff diagnostics without an intended behavioural change.
- Verified that all 13 targeted Tier-1 regression tests pass.
- Verified that Ruff and Black checks pass over the configured targets.
- Verified that the complete quality gate exits with code 0 on LXPlus.
- Preserved unrelated working-tree content by using explicit Git paths.
- Kept generated `post_fit.pdf` outputs outside the current Tier-2 scope.

#### Verified environment

- Python: `Python 3.12.13`
- Python executable: `/afs/cern.ch/user/h/hhook/FrequentistFramework/.venv/bin/python`
- pytest: `pytest 9.1.1`
- Ruff: `ruff 0.16.0`
- Black: `python -m black, 26.5.1 (compiled: yes)`

#### Verification evidence

The complete quality gate was run with:

```bash
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

Results:

- Targeted tests: **13 passed**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black check: **passed**
- Full quality-gate exit code: **0**

#### Remaining work required to complete Tier 2

1. **Update environment provenance**
   - Update `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` with the verified Python 3.12.13 project environment.
   - Record pytest 9.1.1, Ruff 0.16.0, and Black 26.5.1.
   - Preserve the previous Python 3.9.25 snapshot as historical evidence rather than describing it as the active project environment.

2. **Verify clean dependency-lock reproduction**
   - Create a fresh Python 3.12 virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies from `requirements-dev-lock.txt`.
   - Verify the installed Python, pytest, Ruff, and Black versions.
   - Run the complete quality gate in the clean environment.
   - Require a full-gate exit code of 0.

3. **Configure branch upstream tracking**
   - Fetch the remote branch list.
   - Determine whether `origin/tier-2-m365` exists.
   - If it exists, configure it as the upstream branch.
   - If it does not exist, publish the local branch with `git push -u origin tier-2-m365`.

4. **Synchronise the branch**
   - Pull remote changes using an explicit strategy such as `git pull --rebase`.
   - Confirm that all Tier-2 commits remain present after synchronisation.

5. **Perform final verification**
   - Activate the intended project virtual environment.
   - Run the complete quality gate again.
   - Record the final command output and exit code.

6. **Record final completion evidence**
   - Append a new dated activity-log section containing the clean-environment reproduction result, provenance update, branch status, and final gate result.
   - Mark Tier 2 complete only after both the clean reproduction environment and final project environment return full-gate exit code 0.

#### Deferred generated-output decision

The following generated files are not required for the current Tier-2 work:

- `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/post_fit.pdf`
- `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/post_fit.pdf`

Whether these files should remain tracked, be removed from tracking, or be ignored will be handled separately. Until then, avoid repository-wide staging commands such as `git add .` and `git commit -a`.

#### Tier-2 completion criteria

Tier 2 will be complete when:

- Python 3.11 or newer is active and documented;
- pytest, Ruff, and Black are reproducibly pinned;
- `requirements-dev-lock.txt` recreates a working clean environment;
- all 13 targeted tests pass;
- Ruff passes;
- Black check passes;
- the complete quality gate exits with code 0;
- `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` reflects the verified environment;
- `tier-2-m365` tracks the intended remote branch;
- final verification evidence is recorded in this activity log;
- unrelated generated outputs remain outside the Tier-2 change history.


### 2026-07-31 — Tier-2 completion: reproducible Python quality environment

#### Objective

Complete Tier 2 by proving clean dependency-lock reproduction, updating
environment provenance, configuring branch tracking, and verifying the
complete quality gate in both the clean reproduction environment and the
intended project environment.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Recreated a fresh Python 3.12 virtual environment outside the repository.
- Installed the development dependencies from `requirements-dev-lock.txt`.
- Verified that the locked dependencies reproduce the intended pytest,
Ruff, and Black toolchain.
- Configured `tier-2-m365` to track `origin/tier-2-m365`.
- Added a branch-specific `origin` fetch refspec for `tier-2-m365`.
- Verified that the local and remote branch tips were identical.
- Updated `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` with the current supported
environment and clean-reproduction evidence.
- Preserved the Python 3.9.25 environment as a historical pre-Tier-2
snapshot.
- Kept unrelated generated outputs outside the Tier-2 change set.

#### Clean-environment verification

- Verification timestamp: 2026-07-30T16:07:19+02:00
- Python executable:
`/tmp/hhook/tmp.2Vv9EivLbA/tier2-clean-venv/bin/python`
- Python: 3.12.13
- pytest: 9.1.1
- Ruff: 0.16.0
- Black: 26.5.1
- Dependency source: `requirements-dev-lock.txt`
- Targeted tests: 13 passed in 0.21 seconds
- Ruff check: passed
- Black check: passed
- Full quality-gate exit code: 0

#### Branch verification

- Upstream branch: `origin/tier-2-m365`
- Local commit at synchronization:
`a7e8db56408a2413122af0e4a6880b3580012f07`
- Upstream commit at synchronization:
`a7e8db56408a2413122af0e4a6880b3580012f07`
- Branch divergence: none

#### Final project-environment verification

- Python: 3.12.13
- pytest: 9.1.1
- Ruff: 0.16.0
- Black: 26.5.1
- Targeted tests: 13 passed
- Ruff check: passed
- Black check: passed
- Full quality-gate exit code: 0
- Gate output:
`/tmp/frequentist_framework_tier2_final_gate.log`

#### Completion status

Tier 2 is complete. The project now has a supported Python environment,
a reproducibly pinned development toolchain, a passing complete quality
gate, updated environment provenance, and a synchronized tracked branch.

CLs integration, broader structural refactoring, orchestration, and the
generated-output policy remain outside Tier 2.

### 2026-07-31 — Modular Tier-1 and Tier-2 checker LXPlus verification and scope correction

#### Objective

Verify the newly added modular Tier-1 and Tier-2 check framework on LXPlus using the supported project environment, identify checker-specific failures, and preserve the established Tier-2 quality scope.

#### Substantial changes and verification completed

- Copied the modular `tier_checks/` framework into the LXPlus repository checkout.
- Confirmed that the framework contains 26 Python files under `tier_checks/`.
- Confirmed that the separate framework test file, `tests/test_tier_checks.py`, was not copied and remains to be restored before the framework is marked complete.
- Activated the supported repository-local Python environment.
- Verified the active toolchain:
  - Python 3.12.13
  - pytest 9.1.1
  - Ruff 0.16.0
  - Black 26.5.1
- Confirmed that automatic discovery finds all 12 modular checks:
  - six Tier-1 checks;
  - six Tier-2 checks.
- Ran the complete fast check mode.
- Fast-mode result:
  - PASS: 7
  - FAIL: 0
  - WARN: 0
  - SKIP: 5
- The five skipped checks were the expected in-depth-only checks.

#### In-depth verification results

The complete in-depth suite was run on LXPlus.

The following Tier-1 checks passed:

- program locations;
- deterministic reference regeneration;
- frozen-reference schema;
- targeted regression tests;
- J100/J50 workflow input contracts;
- J100/J50 recorded workflow outputs.

The targeted Tier-1 regression suite passed with 13 tests.

The following recorded background-only output logs were found and were non-empty:

- `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/quickFitLog_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.log`
- `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/quickFitLog_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.log`

The following Tier-2 checks passed:

- development dependency files;
- supported Python environment;
- pinned pytest, Ruff, and Black versions;
- the existing complete quality gate.

The authoritative complete quality gate passed with:

- 13 targeted tests passed;
- Ruff passed;
- Black passed;
- exit code 0.

The initial modular in-depth result was:

- PASS: 10
- FAIL: 2
- WARN: 0
- SKIP: 0
- exit code: 1

#### Diagnosed modular-check failures

The two failures were confined to the newly added standalone Ruff and Black wrapper checks.

The Black wrapper invoked:

```text
python -m black --check .
```

This incorrectly expanded the check to the complete repository. It attempted to process unrelated legacy Python files, Markdown files, ROOT binary files, and other files outside the established Tier-2 scope.

The Ruff wrapper invoked:

```text
python -m ruff check .
```

This also inspected the complete repository and reported findings in files outside the established Tier-2 target set.

These failures do not indicate a failure of the established Tier-2 quality gate. The existing `scripts/quality_check.py` continued to pass because it uses the intended explicit list of seven Tier-1 source and test targets.

#### Partial correction performed

- Began correcting the modular Ruff and Black checks so that they use an explicit quality-target list rather than the repository root.
- Ran Black on the new `tier_checks/` directory.
- Black reformatted 16 new checker Python files.
- Black then exited with code 123 because `tier_checks/README.md` was also passed to Black and was incorrectly parsed as Python.
- No repository-wide formatting was applied.
- No unrelated legacy source files, ROOT files, or generated analysis outputs were modified by Black.
- The correction is not yet complete.

#### Current status and remaining work

The modular framework is operational, all Tier-1 checks pass on LXPlus, and the authoritative Tier-2 quality gate remains fully passing.

The following work remains before the modular checker can be marked complete:

- Update the Ruff wrapper to receive only the authoritative Tier-2 Python targets and explicit `*.py` files under `tier_checks/`.
- Update the Black wrapper to receive only the authoritative Tier-2 Python targets and explicit `*.py` files under `tier_checks/`.
- Ensure that neither wrapper receives `.` or the complete `tier_checks/` directory as a formatting target.
- Run Black against the explicit checker Python-file list.
- Run Ruff against the explicit checker Python-file list.
- Recompile the checker package.
- Confirm that all 12 checks remain discoverable.
- Rerun the Tier-2 in-depth suite.
- Rerun the complete Tier-1 and Tier-2 in-depth suite.
- Require a final result of 12 passed, 0 failed, 0 warnings, and 0 skipped.
- Restore `tests/test_tier_checks.py`.
- Run the framework-specific tests and require two tests to pass.
- Review all changes before staging.
- Keep temporary reports, copied archives, unrelated generated files, and `post_fit.pdf` outputs outside the commit.

#### Scope boundary

The checker did not launch the complete J100 or J50 fit workflows. Verification remained limited to recorded paths, input and output contracts, existing background-only outputs, deterministic reference regeneration, regression tests, development tooling, and the established quality gate.

### 2026-07-31 — Tier-1 review feedback: strict reference validation

#### Objective

Resolve merge-review feedback for the Tier-1 analysis-reference validator and add regression coverage for the new failure modes.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Updated `python/analysis_reference.py` to reject unexpected top-level workflows in addition to missing required workflows.
- Updated workflow-payload validation to reject unexpected keys rather than silently discarding them.
- Updated optional `BHresults.json` handling to:
  - convert JSON decoding and file-read failures into clear `ValueError` exceptions;
  - reject valid JSON whose top-level payload is not an object;
  - preserve the existing validation of `pyBHresult` and `global_Pval`.
- Added five focused regression tests to `tests/test_analysis_reference.py` covering:
  - unexpected workflows;
  - unexpected workflow payload keys;
  - malformed BH JSON;
  - non-object BH JSON;
  - `OSError` while reading `BHresults.json`.
- Removed the accidentally added `test.md` file before merge.

#### Verification performed

- Black passed for the changed implementation and test files.
- Ruff passed for the changed implementation and test files.
- The complete targeted Tier-1 test set was run with:

  `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`

- Result: **18 tests passed in 0.42 seconds**.
- The reviewed changes were committed as:
  - `74ef39bda848b558bf3eb74a5f4bd0c077f78a65`
  - `Address Tier-1 analysis reference review feedback`
- Pull request #4 was merged into `upstream/harry` at merge commit:
  - `cb691d7`

#### Scope

The changes are limited to Tier-1 reference validation, its regression tests, activity-log documentation, and removal of the accidental `test.md` file.

The authoritative J100/J50 background-only workflow lock remains unchanged. CLs integration remains deferred.

### 2026-08-20: Tier-1 executable characterization safety foundation

#### Objective

Prepare the authoritative J100 and J50 workflows for a trustworthy executable characterization gate.

The intended final gate must rerun:

- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`

in fresh isolated output directories, then extract and compare the newly generated scientific results against frozen references.

This work focused on preventing false-positive test results before attempting the full analysis reruns.

#### Substantial changes completed

- **Added isolated output-directory support**
  - Updated `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`.
  - Updated `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`.
  - Both launchers now use `ANAFIT_OUTPUT_DIR` when it is provided.
  - The existing default output root, `run/fits`, remains unchanged for normal user execution.
  - This allows future integration tests to write into fresh temporary directories instead of overwriting or reusing committed outputs.

- **Corrected analysis return-status propagation**
  - Updated `python/run_anaFit.py` so `main()` returns the result from `run_anaFit()`.
  - Previously, the return value was discarded, allowing a failed analysis to appear as a successful process exit.
  - Analysis failures can now propagate through Python to the shell launcher and eventually to pytest.

- **Added mandatory external-command validation**
  - Added `execute_required()` to `python/run_anaFit.py`.
  - The helper rejects:
    - commands that return a nonzero exit status;
    - commands that return success without creating their required output files.
  - This establishes a consistent contract for mandatory scientific commands and their artifacts.

- **Hardened XMLReader workspace generation**
  - XMLReader is now treated as mandatory.
  - A nonzero XMLReader exit status terminates the analysis.
  - A successful exit without the expected workspace file also terminates the analysis.
  - The previous warning-and-continue behavior was removed from this path.

- **Hardened quickFit execution**
  - quickFit is now treated as mandatory.
  - A nonzero quickFit exit status terminates the analysis.
  - A successful exit without the expected fit-result file or quickFit log also terminates the analysis.
  - This prevents later extraction from consuming missing, incomplete, or stale fit outputs.

- **Added launcher-level failure propagation**
  - Both authoritative shell launchers now inspect the exit status from `python/run_anaFit.py`.
  - A failed Python analysis causes the launcher to print an error and exit with the same nonzero status.
  - Later plotting commands are not allowed to hide an earlier analysis failure.

- **Added focused regression tests**
  - Added `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
  - Added the new test file to the explicit test targets in `scripts/quality_check.py`.
  - The tests use controlled dependency stubs and do not run ROOT, XMLReader, quickFit, BumpHunter, or the full J100/J50 workflows.
  - Current coverage verifies:
    - successful analysis-status propagation;
    - failed analysis-status propagation;
    - acceptance of a successful mandatory command with its required output;
    - rejection of a nonzero mandatory-command status;
    - rejection of a missing required output;
    - termination after XMLReader failure, before quickFit starts;
    - termination after quickFit failure, before ROOT-based extraction starts.

#### Verification performed

- Baseline branch:
  - `tier-2-m365`
- Pre-change baseline commit:
  - `d50e925a1dad14ebb9254f50c90afe88a0415964`

- Focused regression tests:
  - Command: `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q`
  - Result: **7 passed**

- Python syntax validation:
  - Command: `python -m py_compile python/run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: exit code **0**
  - Six pre-existing invalid-regex-escape `SyntaxWarning` messages remain in the legacy analysis file.

- Ruff validation:
  - Checked `scripts/quality_check.py` and `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
  - Result: **passed**

- Black validation:
  - Checked `scripts/quality_check.py` and `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
  - Result: **passed**
  - Both files were already correctly formatted.

- Shell syntax validation:
  - `bash -n scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
  - Result: exit code **0**
  - `bash -n scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`
  - Result: exit code **0**

#### Current status

The output-isolation and failure-propagation foundation is complete and covered by focused tests.

The authoritative executable characterization gate is **not yet complete**. No real J100 or J50 analysis rerun was performed as part of this activity.

The current tests prove that important failures can be detected and propagated, but they do not yet prove that the complete scientific workflows reproduce the frozen results.

#### Remaining Tier-1 work

Before the executable characterization gate can be accepted:

- Add launcher-level tests proving that a simulated Python analysis failure:
  - produces a nonzero launcher exit status;
  - prevents later plotting commands from running.
- Apply mandatory failure handling to generated binning and BumpHunter execution.
- Decide whether plotting commands are optional diagnostics or required workflow stages.
- Define the complete required-artifact set for fresh J100 and J50 runs.
- Add slow integration tests that:
  - use fresh temporary output directories;
  - execute the actual authoritative J100 and J50 launchers;
  - reject stale or missing outputs;
  - extract results only from newly generated artifacts;
  - compare those results with frozen references.
- Demonstrate that a deliberately perturbed scientific result causes the characterization comparison to fail.
- Run the complete Tier-1 and Tier-2 quality gates after integration.
- Address or explicitly account for the six pre-existing Python `SyntaxWarning` messages if the final acceptance gate requires zero warnings.

#### Scope boundary

This activity did not perform Tier-3 structural refactoring, add orchestration, change the established J100/J50 scientific configuration, or extend the frozen reference to CLs.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain blocked until the test system successfully reruns and validates the authoritative J100/J50 workflows.

- Complete established Tier-1/Tier-2 quality gate:
  - Command: `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
  - Targeted tests: **25 passed in 0.20 seconds**
  - Ruff: **passed**
  - Black: **passed**
  - Warnings: **0**
  - Skipped tests: **0**
  - Full quality-gate exit code: **0**
### 2026-08-20: Tier-1 BumpHunter execution and result-validation hardening

#### Objective

Harden the conditional BumpHunter masking path before running the authoritative J100 and J50 workflows as executable characterization tests.

The goal was to prevent a failed BumpHunter invocation, stale output file, malformed JSON result, or invalid masking interval from reaching the masked-refit stage.

#### Substantial changes completed

- **Made BumpHunter execution mandatory**
  - Updated `python/run_anaFit.py` so the BumpHunter masking-window command uses the established `execute_required()` contract.
  - A nonzero BumpHunter process status now terminates the analysis.
  - A successful process status without the expected `BHresults.json` output also terminates the analysis.

- **Prevented stale BumpHunter output reuse**
  - The analysis now removes a pre-existing `BHresults.json` before starting a new BumpHunter calculation.
  - This prevents a failed invocation from silently reusing results from an earlier analysis run.
  - The masking path requires a newly generated JSON output.

- **Used the BumpHunter environment interpreter directly**
  - Replaced the shell sequence that activated the environment, ran BumpHunter, and then deactivated it.
  - The workflow now invokes `pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3` directly.
  - This ensures the captured return status belongs to `python/FindBHWindow.py` and cannot be hidden by a later shell command.

- **Added validated BumpHunter result loading**
  - Added `load_bumphunter_results()` to `python/run_anaFit.py`.
  - The loader rejects:
    - unreadable result files;
    - malformed JSON;
    - JSON values that are not objects;
    - missing `BlindRange`, `MaskMin`, or `MaskMax` fields;
    - non-integer-compatible mask limits;
    - mask ranges where `MaskMin` is equal to or greater than `MaskMax`;
    - empty or non-string `BlindRange` values.
  - Validated mask limits are converted to integers before the masked refit.
  - Invalid results stop the workflow before masked XML files or masked fit outputs are produced.

- **Confirmed canonical resolution-binning inputs**
  - Verified that both canonical resolution-binning files exist and are tracked:
    - `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/mjjResolutionBinning_481.root`
    - `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/mjjResolutionBinning_344.root`
  - These files are treated as required immutable inputs for the canonical J100 and J50 characterization runs.
  - The canonical tests will not regenerate or modify these tracked inputs.

- **Expanded focused regression coverage**
  - Extended `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` with BumpHunter result-validation tests.
  - Added coverage for:
    - acceptance of a valid BumpHunter payload;
    - rejection of malformed JSON;
    - rejection of missing required fields;
    - rejection of nonnumeric mask limits;
    - rejection of reversed mask limits;
    - rejection of zero-width mask ranges.

#### Verification performed

- Python syntax validation:
  - Command: `python -m py_compile python/run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: exit code **0**

- Existing safety regression suite after BumpHunter execution hardening:
  - Result: **9 passed**

- Formatting of the expanded test file:
  - Command: `python -m black tests/test_run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: **1 file reformatted successfully**

- Ruff validation:
  - Command: `python -m ruff check tests/test_run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: **passed**

- Expanded focused safety and BumpHunter validation suite:
  - Command: `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q`
  - Result: **15 passed in 0.16 seconds**

#### Current status

The BumpHunter command and result-validation logic are now substantially safer and covered by focused tests.

The current tests validate the standalone BumpHunter result loader, but they do not yet exercise the complete conditional BumpHunter branch inside `run_anaFit()`.

No real J100 or J50 analysis rerun was performed as part of this activity.

#### Remaining Tier-1 work

Before attempting the authoritative analysis reruns:

- Add execution-path tests proving that:
  - a stale `BHresults.json` is removed before BumpHunter runs;
  - a BumpHunter process failure terminates the analysis;
  - a successful BumpHunter process without a fresh JSON output terminates the analysis;
  - invalid fresh BumpHunter output prevents the masked refit.
- Run the complete established Tier-1 and Tier-2 quality gate.
- Define the required fresh-output artifacts for J100 and J50.
- Execute both authoritative workflows in clean isolated output directories.
- Extract scientific results only from the fresh outputs.
- Compare the fresh results against the frozen references.
- Demonstrate that a deliberate scientific-result perturbation causes the comparison to fail.

#### Scope boundary

This activity did not change the canonical J100/J50 scientific configuration, enable CLs, perform Tier-3 structural refactoring, or add Tier-4 orchestration.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain blocked until the authoritative executable characterization gate passes.

#### BumpHunter execution-path and complete quality-gate verification

- Expanded focused executable-characterization safety suite:
  - Command: `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q`
  - Result: **19 passed in 0.18 seconds**
  - Ruff: **passed**
  - Black: **passed**

- Complete established Tier-1/Tier-2 quality gate:
  - Command: `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
  - Targeted tests: **37 passed in 0.23 seconds**
  - Ruff: **passed**
  - Black: **passed**
  - Warnings: **0**
  - Skipped tests: **0**
  - Full quality-gate exit code: **0**

The BumpHunter execution path is now covered for stale-output removal, process failure, missing fresh output, valid output loading, and invalid fresh output rejection.

This result verifies the executable-characterization safety foundation. It does not yet constitute the final Tier-1 executable characterization gate because the tests have not rerun and compared the real J100 and J50 analyses.

### 2026-08-20: Authoritative J100/J50 executable characterization gate passes

#### Objective

Complete the highest-priority Tier-1 safety requirement by proving that the test system reruns the actual authoritative J100 and J50 analysis workflows, validates newly generated artifacts, and compares fresh scientific results against the frozen reference.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Added the explicitly marked slow integration test:
  - `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`
- Registered the pytest markers:
  - `integration`
  - `requires_root`
- Kept the slow scientific gate separate from the established fast/full development-quality gate.
- The integration test:
  - executes `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` through Bash;
  - executes `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh` through Bash;
  - redirects both workflows into a fresh pytest temporary output root;
  - requires the expected workspace, fit result, fit parameters, post-fit result, quickFit log, generated configurations, and `analysis_results.json`;
  - requires every scientific artifact to be fresh and nonempty;
  - rejects unexpected masked-fit or BumpHunter outputs;
  - builds the analysis payload exclusively from newly generated outputs;
  - compares the complete fresh J100/J50 payload against the frozen reference.

- Added machine-readable scientific result manifests:
  - `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/analysis_results.json`
  - `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/analysis_results.json`
- Updated the frozen reference with the accepted post-fit chi-square p-values:
  - J100: `0.018448750724012808`
  - J50: `0.07853114301666252`
- Preserved the current background-only scope:
  - no BumpHunter masking was triggered;
  - `p_bh` remains null;
  - `cls_limit_points` remains empty.

#### Executable characterization verification

- Command:

  `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

- Result:
  - **1 passed**
  - Runtime: **175.18 seconds**
  - J100 authoritative workflow: **passed**
  - J50 authoritative workflow: **passed**
  - Fresh artifact validation: **passed**
  - Manifest-backed scientific extraction: **passed**
  - Frozen-reference comparison: **passed**

#### Scientific results protected by the gate

The executable characterization gate now protects:

- J100 background-only fit parameters;
- J50 background-only fit parameters;
- J100 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- J50 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- expected absence of BumpHunter output for the canonical successful unmasked runs;
- expected background-only reference schema;
- expected empty CLs list under the current scope lock;
- freshness and presence of the required scientific artifacts.

#### Current status

The test system now reruns the real authoritative J100 and J50 workflows instead of only rereading committed outputs.

The primary executable-characterization requirement has passed.

Before this Tier-1 slice is closed, remaining verification should prove that a deliberate scientific-result perturbation fails the comparison, rerun the complete established quality gate, and review repository hygiene and final diffs.

#### Known non-blocking findings

- The J100 and J50 launcher files are not executable in the current Git mode and are invoked through Bash by the integration test.
- The post-fit plotting macro attempts to open masked artifacts even when masking was not triggered.
- Those plotting messages do not affect the scientific fit result or executable characterization comparison.
- CLs remains outside the current background-only scope.

#### Scope boundary

No Tier-3 structural refactoring or Tier-4 orchestration was performed.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain blocked until final deliberate-drift verification and complete gate verification are recorded.

#### Final executable-characterization acceptance verification

The Tier-1 executable-characterization safety work received both scientific and development-gate verification.

##### Deliberate scientific-drift detection

A temporary copy of the frozen reference was modified by changing the protected J100 chi-square p-value:

- Original J100 `p_chi2`: `0.018448750724012808`
- Perturbed J100 `p_chi2`: `0.02844875072401281`

The comparison correctly rejected the perturbed reference.

Result:

- Deliberate scientific perturbation: **detected**
- Repository reference modified: **no**
- False acceptance of changed scientific output: **no**

##### Final established Tier-1/Tier-2 quality gate

Command:

`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`

Result:

- Targeted tests collected: **48**
- Targeted tests passed: **48**
- Failed: **0**
- Warnings: **0**
- Skipped: **0**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**
- Full quality-gate exit code: **0**
- Test runtime: **0.36 seconds**

##### Slow executable scientific gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Result:

- Integration tests passed: **1**
- Failed: **0**
- Runtime: **175.18 seconds**
- J100 authoritative workflow rerun: **passed**
- J50 authoritative workflow rerun: **passed**
- Fresh artifact validation: **passed**
- Manifest-backed fit-parameter extraction: **passed**
- Manifest-backed chi-square p-value extraction: **passed**
- Frozen-reference comparison: **passed**

##### Tier-1 acceptance status

The highest-priority executable-characterization requirement is now satisfied.

The test system reruns the actual authoritative J100 and J50 workflows in fresh isolated output directories. It no longer depends only on rereading committed analysis products.

The accepted scientific baseline now protects:

- J100 background-only fit parameters;
- J50 background-only fit parameters;
- J100 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- J50 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- expected unmasked workflow behavior;
- expected absence of BumpHunter output for the canonical runs;
- freshness and presence of required scientific artifacts;
- the current background-only schema with CLs intentionally deferred.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 may remain blocked until the complete change set is reviewed and committed, but the executable characterization gate itself is passing.

#### Final completion status

The previously listed remaining acceptance checks are now complete:

- deliberate scientific-result perturbation was detected successfully;
- the established full quality gate passed with 48 tests, 0 failures, 0 warnings, and 0 skipped;
- Ruff and Black passed;
- the full quality-gate exit code was 0;
- the authoritative executable characterization test passed after rerunning both J100 and J50 from fresh isolated outputs.

The Tier-1 executable characterization gate is complete and passing.

Earlier statements in this activity log describing the gate as incomplete record intermediate project checkpoints and are superseded by this final completion status.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain outside this change set. Any decision to begin Tier 3 should follow review and commit of this completed Tier-1 safety work.
### 2026-08-20: Tier-1 and Tier-2 explicit coverage audit and gate expansion

#### Objective

Audit the original Tier-1 and Tier-2 requirements bullet by bullet and require explicit automated evidence for each completed claim.

This activity expanded the test system beyond basic workflow characterization to cover:

- canonical scientific launcher arguments;
- observable-specific numerical tolerances;
- selected ROOT histogram comparison behavior;
- external dependency revisions;
- scientific runtime readiness;
- generated-output ownership;
- plotting independence;
- launcher permissions;
- clean development-environment reproduction;
- CI quality-gate policy;
- optional pre-commit policy;
- known installation and bootstrap deficiencies;
- initial building blocks for expanded machine-readable provenance.

#### Canonical scientific workflow coverage

The launcher tests now explicitly protect the canonical J100 and J50 analysis contracts.

For J100, the tests verify:

- input file:
  `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J100_dataAll.root`;
- histogram:
  `hists_yStar06_rejectEta_10_16/afterSelection/nominal/h_mjj`;
- fit range:
  `481` to `3000`;
- six-parameter background model;
- prefit enabled;
- mask threshold `0.01`;
- signal fitting disabled;
- limit setting disabled.

For J50, the tests verify:

- input file:
  `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J50_dataAll.root`;
- histogram:
  `hists_yStar06_massCut/HLT_j0_perf_ds1_L1J50/h_mjj`;
- fit range:
  `344` to `2079`;
- six-parameter background model;
- prefit enabled;
- mask threshold `0.01`;
- signal fitting disabled;
- limit setting disabled.

Verification result:

- canonical launcher contract tests: **2 passed**;
- selected launcher tests deselected: **20**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**.

CLs remains intentionally deferred. The schema continues to require `cls_limit_points`, and both canonical background-only references continue to require an empty list.

#### Observable-specific scientific comparison policy

Added an explicit tolerance-aware comparison policy for analysis references.

Current provisional tolerances:

- fit-parameter relative tolerance: `1e-6`;
- fit-parameter absolute tolerance: `1e-8`;
- p-value relative tolerance: `1e-5`;
- p-value absolute tolerance: `1e-8`.

The comparison keeps exact structural checks for:

- workflow names;
- workflow payload keys;
- fit-parameter names;
- presence versus absence of BumpHunter p-values;
- CLs list structure and contents.

Focused tests prove that:

- identical payloads pass;
- small fit-parameter drift within tolerance passes;
- small p-value drift within tolerance passes;
- excessive fit-parameter drift fails;
- excessive p-value drift fails;
- changed parameter names fail;
- absent versus present BumpHunter results fail;
- changed CLs structure fails.

Verification result:

- explicit tolerance tests: **8 passed**;
- selected tests deselected: **16**.

The authoritative J100/J50 executable characterization test was updated to use the same tolerance-aware comparison policy.

Verification result:

- executable scientific gate: **1 passed**;
- runtime: **185.64 seconds**.

The tolerance values are technically explicit and tested but remain provisional until approved scientifically.

#### ROOT histogram-comparison coverage

Expanded `tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py` from low-level numerical helper coverage to explicit selected-histogram behavior.

The test suite now covers:

- exact numerical equality;
- exact numerical mismatch;
- absolute tolerance;
- relative tolerance;
- NaN handling;
- zero-reference relative differences;
- missing ROOT objects;
- rejection of non-histogram ROOT objects;
- nested ROOT object paths;
- histogram-class mismatches;
- differing bin counts;
- changed bin contents;
- changed bin errors;
- changed bin edges;
- accepted content drift within tolerance.

Verification result:

- ROOT comparator tests: **17 passed**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**.

The accurate capability boundary is that the comparator checks explicitly selected TH1 histogram paths, including nested paths. It does not automatically discover and recursively compare every object in a ROOT file.

#### Plotting separated from scientific acceptance

Added `ANAFIT_SKIP_PLOTS=1` support to both authoritative launchers.

Normal user execution continues to produce plots by default. The scientific integration gate now disables plots explicitly so scientific acceptance depends only on:

- generated configurations;
- workspace output;
- fit result;
- fit-parameter output;
- post-fit ROOT output;
- quickFit log;
- analysis result manifest;
- numerical comparison with the frozen reference.

The required-artifact contract explicitly excludes PDF and other visual outputs.

Verification results:

- successful J100 launcher with plots disabled: **passed**;
- successful J50 launcher with plots disabled: **passed**;
- scientific artifact contract excludes plots: **passed**;
- real no-plot J100/J50 characterization gate: **1 passed**;
- scientific-gate runtime: **163.31 seconds**.

Plotting warnings and missing diagnostic plots can no longer determine scientific acceptance.

#### Authoritative launcher permissions

The documented direct launcher commands previously failed because both scripts were tracked with mode `100644`.

Restored executable permissions for:

- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`;
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`.

The integration test now invokes the launchers directly rather than through an explicit Bash command.

Added an automated test requiring both authoritative launchers to have an executable permission bit.

Verification result:

- launcher permission test: **passed**;
- direct-execution J100/J50 integration gate: **1 passed**;
- selected non-integration test: **1 deselected**;
- runtime: **182.97 seconds**.

The executable behavior now matches the commands documented in `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`.

#### Generated-output ownership

Added explicit repository-policy tests to verify that routine generated outputs remain ignored.

The policy tests cover synthetic:

- ROOT files;
- PDF files;
- XML files;
- log files.

The tests also verify that only the two canonical result manifests are re-included:

- `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/analysis_results.json`;
- `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/analysis_results.json`.

Existing generated ROOT, PDF, XML, and log products under the canonical directories were confirmed to be tracked legacy fixtures rather than newly exposed files.

Verification results:

- narrow ignore-policy test: **passed**;
- no unexpected untracked generated products test: **passed**.

#### External dependency revision contract

Added explicit prepared-environment tests for:

- `xmlAnaWSBuilder`;
- `quickFit`;
- `workspaceCombiner`;
- `pyBumpHunter`.

Pinned revisions:

- `xmlAnaWSBuilder`:
  `6b84050f3c0206a6f30eb40b103cc101e68505cc`;
- `quickFit`:
  `0408030b6c8d74a2e2c27a864a02756132d08f5a`;
- `workspaceCombiner`:
  `7d484ad3f89c4075d2c567aa4503fc56e1bb9468`;
- `pyBumpHunter`:
  `91f49a622bd77622edb02a1a2788fc12835e5b72`.

The tests verify:

- every required checkout exists;
- every checkout is readable by Git;
- every checkout matches the pinned revision;
- no checkout contains tracked source modifications.

Untracked build and environment directories such as `cmake/`, `RooFitExtensions/`, and `pyBH_env/` are tolerated.

Verification result:

- prepared dependency tests: **2 passed**.

#### Installation and bootstrap deficiencies

Added explicit tests for the installation contract.

Passing checks:

- `install.sh` records every expected dependency revision;
- `.gitmodules` declares all four expected dependency paths.

Known deficiencies are represented by strict expected-failure tests:

- `.gitmodules` declares dependencies, but the top-level Git index has no corresponding `160000` gitlink entries;
- `install.sh` contains active destructive `rm -rf` operations.

Verification result:

- installation-policy tests passed: **2**;
- strict expected failures: **2**;
- deselected unrelated tests: **9**.

These expected failures keep the known installation deficiencies visible without falsely marking fresh-clone reproducibility as complete.

Fresh-clone dependency acquisition and non-destructive bootstrap behavior remain high-priority Tier-1 work.

#### Scientific runtime readiness

Verified the separation between the development-quality environment and the scientific analysis environment.

Development-quality environment:

- Python `3.12.13`;
- pytest `9.1.1`;
- Ruff `0.16.0`;
- Black `26.5.1`.

Scientific environment selected by `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`:

- LCG release `LCG_102a`;
- platform `x86_64-centos9-gcc11-opt`;
- Python `3.9.12`;
- ROOT/PyROOT `6.26/08`.

Both `xmlAnaWSBuilder/setup_lxplus.sh` and `quickFit/setup_lxplus.sh` explicitly select the same LCG release.

Added an explicit runtime-readiness test covering:

- successful setup;
- scientific Python version;
- ROOT and PyROOT versions;
- executable XMLReader;
- executable quickFit;
- executable BumpHunter Python environment;
- both canonical J100/J50 data inputs;
- both canonical resolution-binning inputs.

Verification result:

- authoritative scientific-runtime readiness test: **1 passed**.

The earlier ROOT `6.40.02` observation describes the shell before authoritative setup. The actual J100/J50 analyses use ROOT `6.26/08`.

#### Test-gate separation

Registered the pytest marker:

- `requires_analysis_dependencies`.

Applied it only to the two external-checkout tests.

The ordinary fast and full gates now exclude those prepared-environment checks while retaining:

- repository-root checks;
- frozen snapshot checks;
- generated-output ownership checks;
- analysis-reference tests;
- ROOT comparator tests;
- launcher and BumpHunter safety tests.

Verification results:

- lightweight repository tests: **4 passed**, **2 deselected**;
- prepared dependency tests: **2 passed**, **4 deselected**;
- fast quality gate: **58 passed**, **2 deselected**, exit code **0**.

The authoritative gate commands are now separated as follows:

- lightweight development gate:
  `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`;
- prepared dependency gate:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`;
- scientific executable characterization gate:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`.

#### CI policy

Expanded `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml` into the Tier-1 and Tier-2 lightweight quality workflow.

The workflow now:

- uses `actions/checkout@v4`;
- uses `actions/setup-python@v5`;
- selects Python `3.12.13`;
- installs `requirements-dev-lock.txt`;
- runs `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`;
- covers `harry` and `tier-2-m365`;
- does not launch the CERN-only integration test;
- does not require prepared external dependency checkouts.

Added an explicit CI policy test.

Verification result:

- CI policy test: **1 passed**.

Local complete lightweight verification after the CI update:

- tests passed: **59**;
- prepared dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**;
- exit code: **0**.

An actual hosted CI run remains pending until the workflow is committed and pushed.

#### Optional pre-commit policy

Documented pre-commit as optional and outside the authoritative Tier-2 acceptance gate.

Current policy:

- `pre-commit` is not installed or pinned;
- contributors are not required to install Git hooks;
- the authoritative quality command is:
  `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`;
- the current Ruff hook version does not match the pinned Tier-2 Ruff version;
- pre-commit remains follow-up work.

Added an explicit policy test.

Verification result:

- optional pre-commit policy test: **1 passed**.

#### Clean dependency-lock reproduction

Created a new temporary Python 3.12 virtual environment outside the repository.

Installed only from `requirements-dev-lock.txt`.

Reproduced versions:

- Python `3.12.13`;
- pytest `9.1.1`;
- Ruff `0.16.0`;
- Black `26.5.1`.

Clean full-gate result:

- tests collected: **62**;
- tests passed: **60**;
- prepared dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**;
- exit code: **0**.

Clean-environment evidence:

- temporary root:
  `/tmp/frequentist-tier2-clean.p2RO1b`;
- full-gate log:
  `/tmp/frequentist-tier2-clean.p2RO1b/full-gate.log`.

The bootstrap upgraded pip to `26.2.1`. Pip itself is not pinned and remains a minor reproducibility follow-up.

#### Initial machine-readable provenance helpers

Added and tested foundational provenance helpers in `python/run_anaFit.py`.

Current helpers cover:

- repository-root discovery from `__file__`;
- deterministic SHA-256 file hashing;
- clear failure for missing files;
- Git revision lookup;
- validation of full 40-character Git revisions;
- clear failure for non-repositories;
- scientific Python version collection;
- scientific Python executable collection;
- active ROOT version collection;
- clear failure when the active ROOT version is unavailable.

Focused verification results:

- repository-root tests: **2 passed**;
- file SHA-256 tests: **2 passed**;
- Git revision tests: **2 passed**;
- scientific runtime collection tests: **2 passed**.

The canonical data and template hashes were also recorded during the audit.

The provenance helpers are tested, but the canonical manifests remain at schema version 1 and do not yet embed full runtime, revision, hash, and invocation provenance.

#### Latest combined gate checkpoint

Latest lightweight full-gate result:

- tests collected: **84**;
- selected tests: **82**;
- tests passed: **80**;
- prepared dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- strict installation-policy expected failures: **2**;

#### Current status

The Tier-1 scientific characterization system is complete and passing for the current background-only J100/J50 scope.

The Tier-2 development-quality environment remains reproducible and passing.

The following items remain incomplete:

- functional Git submodule gitlinks or an equivalent checked-in dependency acquisition manifest;
- non-destructive separation of dependency bootstrap and build operations;
- complete provenance embedded in `analysis_results.json`;
- final provenance-backed regeneration of the J100/J50 manifests;
- actual hosted CI execution after push;
- actual CLs characterization, intentionally deferred;
- scientific approval of the provisional numerical tolerances.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain outside this change set. Tier 3 should not begin until the completed Tier-1/Tier-2 work is reviewed and committed, and the remaining installation-reproducibility risks are explicitly accepted or repaired.

### 2026-08-21: Schema-version-2 scientific provenance completed

#### Objective

Complete machine-readable provenance for the authoritative J100 and J50 background-only executable characterization workflows.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Upgraded `analysis_results.json` from schema version 1 to schema version 2.
- Preserved schema-version-1 reader compatibility for legacy manifests.
- Added strict schema-version-2 provenance validation.
- Added provenance records for:
  - repository commit;
  - active scientific Python version and executable;
  - active ROOT version;
  - `xmlAnaWSBuilder` revision;
  - `quickFit` revision;
  - `workspaceCombiner` revision;
  - `pyBumpHunter` revision;
  - input data path and SHA-256;
  - top-level configuration path and SHA-256;
  - category configuration path and SHA-256;
  - background configuration path and SHA-256;
  - signal configuration path and SHA-256;
  - data histogram;
  - fit-range bounds;
  - signal-enabled state;
  - limit-enabled state;
  - prefit-enabled state;
  - mask threshold.
- Added repository-aware path resolution for relative and absolute scientific inputs.
- Added deterministic file SHA-256 helpers.
- Added Git revision lookup and validation.
- Added scientific runtime collection.
- Connected provenance generation to the successful `run_anaFit()` path.
- Preserved atomic manifest writing.
- Failed analyses still cannot create a misleading success manifest.
- Promoted validated schema-version-2 manifests for both canonical workflows.

#### Canonical scientific manifests

J100:

- schema version: `2`
- status: `success`
- masked: `false`
- `p_chi2`: `0.018448750724012808`

J50:

- schema version: `2`
- status: `success`
- masked: `false`
- `p_chi2`: `0.07853114301666252`

Both canonical manifests pass the production provenance validator and reproduce the frozen scientific reference.

#### Focused verification

- Repository-root helper tests: **2 passed**
- Analysis-path resolution tests: **3 passed**
- File SHA-256 tests: **2 passed**
- File-provenance tests: **3 passed**
- Git revision tests: **2 passed**
- Scientific runtime tests: **2 passed**
- Complete provenance-payload test: **1 passed**
- Provenance-validator tests: **10 passed**
- Schema-version-1 and schema-version-2 manifest tests: **passed**
- Schema-version-2 writer tests: **3 passed**
- Successful unmasked provenance-wiring test: **1 passed**
- Complete `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` suite: **39 passed** before the final wiring test was added
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**

#### Final scientific executable gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Result:

- authoritative J100 rerun: **passed**
- authoritative J50 rerun: **passed**
- fresh schema-version-2 manifest generation: **passed**
- strict provenance validation: **passed**
- fresh artifact validation: **passed**
- tolerance-aware frozen-reference comparison: **passed**
- selected integration tests passed: **1**
- deselected non-integration tests: **2**
- runtime: **116.02 seconds**
- exit code: **0**

#### Current completion status

Machine-readable provenance is complete for the canonical background-only J100 and J50 executable characterization scope.

The executable characterization gate now protects both scientific results and the runtime, dependency, input, configuration, and invocation identity associated with those results.

Remaining known limitations are:

- functional Git submodule gitlinks are still absent;
- `install.sh` remains destructive;
- hosted CI execution remains pending a commit and push;
- CLs characterization remains intentionally deferred;
- numerical tolerances remain provisional pending scientific approval.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain outside this change set.

#### Final schema-version-2 verification checkpoint

The complete verification sequence was rerun after promoting the canonical schema-version-2 J100 and J50 manifests.

##### Lightweight full gate

Command:

`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`

Result:

- tests collected: **105**;
- tests passed: **101**;
- prepared-dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- strict expected installation-policy failures: **2**;
- unexpected failures: **0**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**;
- exit code: **0**.

The two strict expected failures continue to document:

- missing Git index gitlinks for the declared external dependencies;
- destructive `rm -rf` operations in `install.sh`.

##### Prepared-dependency gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`

Result:

- tests passed: **2**;
- tests deselected: **11**;
- failures: **0**;
- exit code: **0**.

The prepared `xmlAnaWSBuilder`, `quickFit`, `workspaceCombiner`, and `pyBumpHunter` checkouts remain at their pinned revisions and contain no tracked source modifications.

##### Scientific executable gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Result:

- tests passed: **1**;
- tests deselected: **2**;
- failures: **0**;
- runtime: **116.02 seconds**;
- exit code: **0**.

The scientific gate successfully:

- reran J100 and J50 from fresh isolated outputs;
- generated fresh schema-version-2 manifests;
- validated complete runtime, dependency, input, configuration, and invocation provenance;
- validated required fresh scientific artifacts;
- reproduced the frozen fit parameters and chi-square p-values within the approved provisional comparison policy;
- remained on the expected unmasked background-only path;
- excluded diagnostic plotting from scientific acceptance.

##### Final status

Machine-readable provenance is complete and passing for the canonical J100 and J50 background-only executable characterization scope.

The remaining known Tier-1 limitations are dependency acquisition and installer safety. These are represented by strict expected-failure tests and must not be described as complete.

Hosted CI execution remains pending commit and push. CLs characterization remains intentionally deferred. Numerical tolerances remain provisional pending scientific approval.

#### Tier-1 and Tier-2 operating documentation synchronized

Updated the user-facing system documentation to match the final verified implementation:

- `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`
- `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`
- `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`

The documents now record:

- schema-version-2 J100 and J50 manifests;
- complete machine-readable scientific provenance;
- canonical numerical chi-square p-values;
- explicit fit-parameter and p-value tolerances;
- the current lightweight, prepared-dependency, runtime-readiness, and scientific gates;
- the Python 3.12.13 development environment;
- the Python 3.9.12 and ROOT 6.26/08 scientific environment;
- plotting independence and executable launcher permissions;
- CI and optional pre-commit policies;
- missing Git submodule gitlinks and destructive installer behavior as known limitations.

Obsolete descriptions of null canonical chi-square p-values, the historical 18-test baseline, unavailable Ruff and Black tooling, and Python 3.9.25 as the active quality environment were removed.

Verification:

- all three documents retain their established repository names;
- no `UPDATED_*` files remain under `doc/`;
- documentation-specific `git diff --check` passed;
- complete repository `git diff --check` passed.

### 2026-08-21: Hosted CI policy-test hardening and Node.js 24 action update

#### Objective

Correct the hosted lightweight quality-gate failure caused by brittle exact-text assertions against human-readable Tier-2 documentation, and update the GitHub Actions dependencies to Node.js 24-compatible releases.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Removed exact prose assertions against `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` from `tests/test_repo_utils.py`.
- Replaced the documentation-wording test with a machine-verifiable policy test confirming that pre-commit is absent from both development dependency manifests.
- Preserved the policy that pre-commit is optional and outside the authoritative Tier-2 acceptance environment.
- Updated the CI policy test so supported GitHub Action versions can be upgraded without requiring obsolete exact versions.
- Updated the hosted workflow:
  - `actions/checkout@v4` to `actions/checkout@v6`;
  - `actions/setup-python@v5` to `actions/setup-python@v6`.
- Kept the hosted workflow limited to the locked lightweight quality gate.
- Made no changes to scientific analysis code, frozen references, provenance records, or J100/J50 workflow contracts.

#### Verification performed

Focused policy tests:

- `test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate`: passed
- `test_precommit_is_not_a_locked_development_dependency`: passed
- Result: **2 passed**

Formatting and linting:

- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**

Complete lightweight quality gate:

- tests collected: **105**
- tests passed: **101**
- prepared-dependency tests deselected: **2**
- strict expected installation-policy failures: **2**
- unexpected failures: **0**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**

#### Current status

The local lightweight gate passes after removing the brittle Markdown prose assertions and updating the GitHub Actions versions.

The two strict expected failures continue to represent:

- missing Git submodule gitlinks;
- destructive `rm -rf` operations in `install.sh`.

The updated workflow must be committed and pushed so the corrected hosted GitHub Actions result can be verified.

#### Scope boundary

This change affects only lightweight repository-policy testing and hosted CI dependencies. It does not change the background-only scientific analysis, the authoritative J100/J50 workflows, numerical references, scientific provenance, or the accepted no-signal scope.

### 2026-08-21: External dependency Git gitlinks repaired

#### Objective

Repair the missing Git index gitlinks for the four declared scientific dependencies so that the parent repository records their verified pinned revisions.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Aligned the dependency URLs in `.gitmodules` with the repositories used by `install.sh` and the verified prepared checkouts:
  - `xmlAnaWSBuilder`: `https://github.com/tofitsch/xmlAnaWSBuilder.git`
  - `quickFit`: `https://github.com/tofitsch/quickFit.git`
  - `workspaceCombiner`: `https://github.com/tofitsch/workspaceCombiner.git`
  - `pyBumpHunter`: `https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyBumpHunter.git`
- Added mode-`160000` Git index gitlinks for:
  - `xmlAnaWSBuilder` at `6b84050f3c0206a6f30eb40b103cc101e68505cc`
  - `quickFit` at `0408030b6c8d74a2e2c27a864a02756132d08f5a`
  - `workspaceCombiner` at `7d484ad3f89c4075d2c567aa4503fc56e1bb9468`
  - `pyBumpHunter` at `91f49a622bd77622edb02a1a2788fc12835e5b72`
- Added `ignore = untracked` for `workspaceCombiner` so local build products do not make the parent repository appear dirty.
- Removed the obsolete strict `xfail` marker from the gitlink policy test.
- Preserved the gitlink test as a normal required passing test.
- Updated the current Tier-1, Tier-2, and environment-provenance documentation.
- Preserved historical activity-log statements describing the previously missing gitlinks.
- Made no changes to dependency source files, scientific results, frozen references, or the authoritative J100/J50 workflow contracts.

#### Verification performed

Gitlink policy test:

- `test_declared_submodules_have_gitlink_entries`: **passed**

Complete repository utility suite:

- tests passed: **12**
- strict expected failures: **1**
- unexpected failures: **0**

Prepared-dependency gate:

- tests passed: **2**
- tests deselected: **11**
- failures: **0**
- exit code: **0**

Complete lightweight quality gate:

- tests collected: **105**
- tests passed: **102**
- prepared-dependency tests deselected: **2**
- strict expected installation-policy failures: **1**
- unexpected failures: **0**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**
- exit code: **0**

Repository validation:

- all four dependency entries use Git index mode `160000`;
- all four entries record the verified pinned revisions;
- all prepared checkouts contain no tracked source modifications;
- `git diff --check` passed.

#### Current status

The missing Git submodule gitlinks limitation is resolved.

The remaining strict expected installation-policy failure documents the destructive `rm -rf` operations in `install.sh`.

Clean-clone scientific dependency acquisition has not yet been verified end to end. The existing prepared LXPlus scientific environment remains verified and unchanged.

#### Scope boundary

This change repairs dependency metadata and repository policy only. It does not modify the background-only scientific analysis, the authoritative J100/J50 workflows, numerical references, schema-version-2 provenance, or the accepted no-signal scope.

### 2026-08-21: Non-destructive installer validation checkpoint

#### Objective

Replace the destructive installer with a verified read-only installation contract and harden the dedicated pyBumpHunter installer.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Removed destructive deletion, direct cloning, pulling, and checkout operations from `install.sh`.
- Made `install.sh` executable and added a read-only `--check` mode.
- Added checks for dependency gitlinks, checked-out revisions, tracked source changes, nested RooFitExtensions revisions, and required files.
- Replaced the pyBumpHunter installer with a non-destructive LCG 102a implementation.
- The pyBumpHunter installer preserves a valid environment and refuses to overwrite an invalid environment.
- Removed unpinned package upgrades, the external virtualenv dependency, LCG 105, and deprecated setup.py installation.
- Added machine-verifiable installer policy tests.
- Removed the obsolete test requiring dependency revisions to be duplicated inside `install.sh`.
- Updated the current Tier-1, Tier-2, and environment-provenance documentation.

#### Verification performed

- `bash install.sh --check`: passed and preserved the repository state.
- pyBumpHunter isolated installation and import test: passed.
- Existing pyBumpHunter environment preservation check: passed.
- Repository utility suite: 13 passed.
- Prepared-dependency gate: 2 passed and 11 deselected.
- Full lightweight gate: 103 passed and 2 deselected.
- Expected failures: 0.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- Shell syntax checks: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

#### Current status

The destructive installer behavior is resolved. The repository now has a verified read-only installation check and a non-destructive pyBumpHunter installer.

A complete non-destructive C++ dependency build mode is not yet enabled. Clean-clone acquisition and building remain to be verified end to end.

#### Scope boundary

This checkpoint changes dependency validation and installation safety only. It does not modify the J100 or J50 scientific workflows, scientific results, frozen references, provenance, or the background-only analysis scope.

### 2026-08-21: Non-destructive dependency build mode completed

#### Objective

Complete and verify the non-destructive dependency build mode for the prepared scientific environment.

#### Changes completed

- Added `install.sh --build`.
- The build runs the read-only dependency contract before compilation.
- Added strict positive-integer validation for `INSTALL_JOBS`.
- Reused existing build directories without deleting them.
- Rebuilt the three pinned RooFitExtensions checkouts.
- Rebuilt xmlAnaWSBuilder, quickFit, and workspaceCombiner.
- Validated XMLReader, quickFit, workspaceCombiner manager, and their required libraries.
- Copied only the required RooFitExtensions products into each parent dependency.
- Avoided `cmake --install` for RooFitExtensions and avoided writes to `/usr/local`.
- Preserved failed build directories for inspection.
- Validated the existing pyBumpHunter environment through the safe installer.
- Updated installer policy tests and removed obsolete build-pending assertions.
- Updated the Tier-1, Tier-2, and environment-provenance documentation.

#### Isolated build verification

- RooFitExtensions and xmlAnaWSBuilder: passed.
- RooFitExtensions and quickFit: passed.
- RooFitExtensions and workspaceCombiner: passed.
- All isolated build directories were removed after testing.
- No tracked dependency source modifications were introduced.

#### Prepared-checkout build verification

- Command: `INSTALL_JOBS=2 bash install.sh --build`.
- Build exit code: 0.
- All three RooFitExtensions copies built successfully.
- xmlAnaWSBuilder, quickFit, and workspaceCombiner built successfully.
- The pyBumpHunter environment validated successfully.
- All 12 protected C++ build artifacts remained present.
- All 12 post-build SHA-256 hashes matched the pre-build baseline exactly.
- Only generated artifact timestamps changed.
- No tracked source modifications were introduced in any dependency.

#### Post-build verification

- Runtime readiness: 1 passed, 2 deselected in 16.39 seconds.
- Authoritative J100/J50 scientific gate: 1 passed, 2 deselected in 152.86 seconds.
- Lightweight gate: 103 passed, 2 deselected.
- Expected failures: 0.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- All relevant exit codes: 0.

#### Current status

The prepared-checkout non-destructive dependency build mode is operational and scientifically verified.

Clean-clone submodule acquisition and building have not yet been verified end to end in a separate fresh checkout.

#### Scope boundary

This change affects installation and dependency build safety only. It does not change the J100 or J50 background-only scientific workflows, frozen references, numerical results, or schema-version-2 provenance.

### 2026-08-21: Redundant modular tier-check framework retired

#### Objective

Audit the experimental `tier_checks/` framework against the completed authoritative Tier-1 and Tier-2 system, remove it if it provided no unique acceptance coverage, and preserve the existing activity-log history unchanged.

#### Coverage audit completed

Every framework component and all 12 modular checks were reviewed against the authoritative tests and operating gates.

The audit found no unique accepted scientific, dependency, repository, installer, build, runtime, or CI protection in `tier_checks/`.

The framework had fallen behind the authoritative system:

- its targeted pytest check omitted `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`;
- its Ruff and Black target list also omitted `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`;
- its Ruff and Black checks targeted the complete `tier_checks/` directory rather than an explicit Python-file list;
- its workflow-input check was weaker than the accepted launcher-contract tests;
- its recorded-output check verified existing non-empty logs rather than fresh scientific execution;
- its reference contract was weaker than the production schema-version-2 provenance validator;
- its full-quality check directly invoked the authoritative `scripts/quality_check.py` gate;
- its in-depth mode duplicated pytest, Ruff, and Black execution;
- warnings and skipped checks counted as successful outcomes.

#### Removal completed

- Removed all 27 tracked files under `tier_checks/`.
- Removed ignored Python bytecode caches left under the retired directory.
- Confirmed that the `tier_checks/` directory no longer exists.
- Updated `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` to record the retirement and identify the authoritative replacement gates.
- Corrected the optional pre-commit wording to refer to the authoritative lightweight quality gate.
- Preserved every existing activity-log entry unchanged.

#### Useful ideas retained for possible future work

- per-command subprocess timeouts;
- optional provenance-backed JSON quality reports;
- requirement-level duration reporting;
- concise failure-output summaries;
- active Python executable and version reporting;
- active tool-version verification derived from the dependency lock;
- non-empty presence checks for authoritative documentation.

These are optional enhancements to the authoritative system and do not require maintaining a second acceptance framework.

#### Verification performed

- Full lightweight gate: 103 passed and 2 prepared-dependency tests deselected.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- Full lightweight gate exit code: 0.
- Prepared-dependency gate: 2 passed and 11 deselected.
- Prepared-dependency gate exit code: 0.
- Repository diff validation: passed.

#### Current status

The repository now has one authoritative Tier-1 and Tier-2 acceptance system rather than two divergent implementations.

The authoritative interfaces remain the lightweight full gate, prepared-dependency gate, runtime-readiness gate, J100/J50 scientific integration gate, installer check mode, and non-destructive dependency build mode.

#### Scope boundary

This change removes redundant experimental checking infrastructure only. It does not modify the authoritative J100 or J50 workflows, scientific results, frozen references, schema-version-2 provenance, dependency revisions, installer behaviour, or accepted background-only analysis scope.

#### 2026-08-27: Copilot merge-review safety corrections

##### Objective

Resolve the ten findings reported by GitHub Copilot during review of pull request 5 before merging the Tier-1 and Tier-2 branch.

##### Changes completed

- Updated mandatory command execution to remove expected outputs before execution, preventing stale XMLReader or quickFit artifacts from satisfying a successful command.
- Added explicit rejection of non-finite values in tolerance-aware scientific comparisons.
- Updated Git provenance collection to reject repositories with staged or unstaged tracked modifications while permitting untracked build products.
- Aligned schema-version-2 production and validation for optional background and signal configuration files by recording absent values as null.
- Preserved validated stable provenance in analysis-reference payloads.
- Added exact comparison of runtime identity, dependency revisions, input identity, configuration identity, and invocation settings.
- Kept repository_commit in full manifests while excluding it from the frozen reference to avoid a self-referential commit cycle.
- Updated quickLimit failure handling so a failed requested limit returns a nonzero status before provenance or success-manifest generation.
- Updated run_injections_anaFit.py to return the run_anaFit status.
- Updated the pyBumpHunter installer to reject an existing environment whose Python version differs from the authoritative scientific Python version.
- Updated the frozen J100 and J50 reference with stable provenance.
- Added focused regression coverage for stale outputs, non-finite values, provenance drift, dirty repositories, quickLimit failure, injection-runner status propagation, nullable configuration provenance, and pyBumpHunter interpreter-version policy.

##### Verification performed

Focused Python suites:

- 105 tests passed.
- Failures: 0.

Authoritative lightweight gate:

- Tests collected: 122.
- Tests passed: 120.
- Prepared-dependency tests deselected: 2.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- Unexpected failures: 0.

Repository validation:

- git diff --check passed.
- Broad legacy formatting changes introduced during review were removed before final verification.
- The resulting change set remains limited to the reviewed safety corrections and their tests.

##### Remaining work

- Commit the reviewed safety corrections.
- Regenerate the canonical J100 and J50 schema-version-2 manifests from the resulting clean committed tree.
- Verify that each regenerated manifest records the new commit.
- Rerun the prepared-dependency, runtime-readiness, scientific characterization, and lightweight gates.
- Resolve the remaining upstream merge conflicts.

#### 2026-08-27: Canonical manifest provenance corrected

##### Objective

Complete the remaining GitHub Copilot review findings by regenerating the canonical J100 and J50 schema-version-2 manifests from a clean committed source revision.

##### Changes completed

- Moved provenance collection to the beginning of run_anaFit(), before generated outputs can modify tracked repository artifacts.
- Retained success-manifest writing at the end of the workflow so failed analyses cannot record success.
- Committed the provenance-ordering correction as:
  - 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556
  - Capture provenance before analysis output generation
- Confirmed the repository was clean before scientific execution.
- Regenerated J100 and J50 in a temporary output root.
- Copied only the regenerated analysis_results.json manifests into the canonical tracked locations.
- Preserved all other tracked scientific artifacts unchanged.

##### Scientific regeneration results

J100:

- Global chi-square p-value: 0.018448750724012808.
- Workflow completed successfully.
- Manifest repository commit:
  - 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556

J50:

- Global chi-square p-value: 0.07853114301666252.
- Workflow completed successfully.
- Manifest repository commit:
  - 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556

##### Verification performed

- Both workflows completed successfully from temporary isolated outputs.
- Both regenerated manifests record the clean source revision used for execution.
- Only the two canonical analysis_results.json files were promoted.
- The canonical reference validation test passed:
  - 1 passed.
  - 43 deselected.
  - Failures: 0.

##### Review status

All ten GitHub Copilot review findings are now resolved at the implementation and canonical-evidence level. The two inaccurate manifest-revision findings are resolved by scientifically regenerating both canonical manifests from clean commit 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556.

##### Remaining verification

- Rerun the prepared-dependency gate.
- Rerun scientific runtime readiness.
- Rerun the authoritative J100/J50 scientific characterization gate.
- Rerun the authoritative lightweight gate.
- Commit the regenerated manifests and this evidence entry.
- Resolve the upstream merge conflicts.

#### 2026-08-27: Copilot review corrections final verification

##### Final verification

Prepared-dependency gate:

- 2 passed.

#### 2026-08-28: GitHub-hosted scientific runtime probe implemented

##### Objective

Begin evaluating whether the authoritative FrequentistFramework scientific runtime can execute on a GitHub-hosted Linux runner before enabling dependency builds or the complete J100/J50 characterization analysis.

##### Changes completed

- Added `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`.
- Kept the hosted scientific probe separate from the existing Tier-1 and Tier-2 lightweight quality workflow.
- Configured manual execution through `workflow_dispatch`.
- Selected the fixed `ubuntu-24.04` GitHub-hosted runner image.
- Restricted workflow permissions to read-only repository contents.
- Added per-branch concurrency control and a 30-minute job timeout.
- Configured recursive submodule checkout without persisted Git credentials.
- Added CernVM-FS setup for:
  - `atlas.cern.ch`;
  - `sft.cern.ch`.
- Pinned the CernVM-FS action to immutable commit:
  - `10197e000cc0add8e54ac4fb73d3ed44e2de72b4`.
- Added clean-checkout, recursive submodule, and `install.sh --check` validation.
- Added CernVM-FS repository probes.
- Added inspection of the hosted operating system, architecture, Python executable, Python version, ROOT version, and PyROOT version.
- Added execution of the existing scientific runtime-readiness pytest gate.
- Deliberately excluded dependency compilation and the complete J100/J50 scientific characterization gate from this initial probe.

##### Local verification

- Confirmed that the workflow contains no literal HTML line-break elements.
- YAML syntax validation passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Reviewed the staged workflow diff.
- The existing lightweight GitHub Actions workflow remains unchanged.

##### Current status

The runtime-probe workflow is implemented locally but has not yet been executed on GitHub Actions. Its first hosted run must determine whether the existing `LCG_102a` `x86_64-centos9-gcc11-opt` scientific environment is compatible with the GitHub-hosted Ubuntu 24.04 runner.

Dependency building, the authoritative J100/J50 scientific characterization gate, caching, scheduled execution, and required-check status remain deferred until the hosted runtime probe passes.

##### Hosted trigger correction

- The initial manual workflow could not be started while it existed only on the feature branch.
- Added a temporary push trigger limited to `github-actions-analysis`.
- Retained `workflow_dispatch` for manual execution after the workflow becomes available from the repository default branch.
- The temporary branch trigger will be removed or revised after the hosted probe has been verified.

##### First hosted probe result and cleanliness-policy adjustment

- GitHub Actions run `33164486810` started successfully from commit `6ca611d51c5a4114c25f86a79ba530d5dbc6bb09`.
- Recursive checkout completed with all four top-level dependencies at their recorded pinned revisions.
- CernVM-FS setup completed before repository validation.
- The job stopped because the CernVM-FS action created an untracked `apt_cache/` directory and the workflow treated any non-clean repository status as fatal.
- Changed the general repository-cleanliness check from a fatal assertion to a GitHub Actions warning with the detected status printed in the log.
- Retained recursive submodule reporting and mandatory `install.sh --check` validation.
- Scientific runtime compatibility remains untested because the first job stopped before the CernVM-FS repository probes and LCG runtime steps.

##### Nested RooFitExtensions acquisition added

- The second hosted probe passed top-level gitlink validation for `xmlAnaWSBuilder`, `quickFit`, `workspaceCombiner`, and `pyBumpHunter`.
- `install.sh --check` then failed because `xmlAnaWSBuilder/RooFitExtensions` was absent.
- Confirmed that none of the three parent dependency revisions records `RooFitExtensions` as a Git gitlink.
- Confirmed that the prepared LXPlus checkouts use the publicly readable repository:
  - `https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas_higgs_combination/software/RooFitExtensions.git`
- Confirmed that the required revision is available:
  - `ba94bfcbfa4f4a4e3541ade09580399e409e8514`
- Added a workflow step that acquires separate RooFitExtensions checkouts for `xmlAnaWSBuilder`, `quickFit`, and `workspaceCombiner`.
- Each checkout is detached at the exact recorded revision and verified before `install.sh --check` runs.
- Kept acquisition outside `install.sh` so its `--check` mode remains read-only.
- LCG and ROOT compatibility remain untested because the second hosted run stopped during dependency validation.

##### Scientific setup shell compatibility corrected

- The next hosted probe reached `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`.
- Scientific setup stopped because the workflow enabled Bash nounset mode and `_DIRXMLWSBUILDER` is intentionally unset before initial environment setup.
- Changed only the two workflow steps that source the scientific setup script from `set -euo pipefail` to `set -eo pipefail`.
- Retained immediate command-failure and pipeline-failure handling.
- Dependency acquisition and validation progressed beyond the previous missing RooFitExtensions failure.
- LCG and ROOT compatibility remain pending the corrected hosted rerun.

##### ATLAS setup errexit compatibility corrected

- The next hosted probe reached ATLAS local environment setup.
- `atlasLocalSetup.sh` refused to continue because Bash errexit mode was enabled by the GitHub Actions shell.
- Updated both scientific setup steps to follow the established `install.sh` pattern:
  - disable errexit and nounset while sourcing `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`;
  - capture the setup exit status;
  - restore errexit;
  - fail explicitly if scientific environment setup returns a nonzero status.
- Setup failures remain fatal and are reported through a GitHub Actions error annotation.
- LCG and ROOT compatibility remain pending the corrected hosted rerun.

##### Ubuntu-compatible LCG platform override added

- The hosted runtime probe established the LCG 102a CentOS 9 view but could not execute its binaries on Ubuntu 24.04.
- Observed missing host-library failures included:
  - `libicuuc.so.67`;
  - `libcrypt.so.2`.
- Confirmed that CVMFS provides the LCG 102a platform:
  - `x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt`.
- Added an opt-in `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM` override to `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`.
- Preserved `x86_64-centos9-gcc11-opt` as the default when the override is unset, retaining the established LXPlus scientific environment.
- Configured the GitHub-hosted runtime-probe job to use:
  - `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM=x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt`.
- The override configures the selected LCG view and reproduces the XMLReader and quickFit path and library setup without modifying the pinned dependency checkouts.
- Shell syntax validation passed.
- Hosted Python, ROOT, dependency-build, and scientific compatibility with the Ubuntu LCG view remain pending rerun.
- The frozen J100/J50 references still record the CentOS 9 Python executable path. Hosted provenance comparison must be addressed before enabling the complete characterization gate.

##### Hosted Ubuntu LCG runtime verified and build phase added

- The hosted probe successfully established the Ubuntu-compatible LCG 102a view.
- Verified scientific runtime:
  - Python 3.9.12;
  - ROOT and PyROOT 6.26/08;
  - Python executable under `x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt`.
- The runtime-readiness test reached its required-artifact checks and failed because the scientific dependencies had not yet been built.
- The first missing executable was:
  - `xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/bin/XMLReader`.
- Added the authoritative non-destructive dependency build command:
  - `INSTALL_JOBS=2 bash install.sh --build`.
- Added post-build `install.sh --check` validation.
- Added the prepared-dependency pytest gate after the build.
- Increased the hosted job timeout from 30 to 90 minutes.
- The complete runtime-readiness gate remains pending the first hosted dependency build.
- A ROOT compiler include-path diagnostic was observed and will be evaluated only if it causes an actual build or runtime failure.

##### Hosted CMake compatibility correction

- The first hosted dependency build established Python 3.9.12 and ROOT 6.26/08 and passed the complete installation-contract check.
- `xmlAnaWSBuilder/RooFitExtensions` configured and built successfully.
- ROOT emitted compiler include-path and C++ standard-library mismatch diagnostics, but the RooFitExtensions build completed.
- The subsequent `xmlAnaWSBuilder` configuration failed because CMake 4.2.1 removed compatibility with projects declaring a minimum CMake version below 3.5.
- Added `-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5` to both centralized CMake configuration paths in `install.sh`:
  - nested RooFitExtensions configuration;
  - parent C++ dependency configuration.
- The pinned external dependency sources remain unchanged.
- Shell syntax validation and `git diff --check` passed.
- Completion of the three RooFitExtensions builds, parent dependency builds, runtime-readiness gate, and scientific characterization gate remains pending the corrected hosted rerun.

##### Hosted dependency build completed

- The corrected hosted run completed all three nested RooFitExtensions builds and the parent scientific dependency builds.
- Post-build `install.sh --check` passed with all top-level gitlinks and nested RooFitExtensions revisions verified.
- The post-build prepared-dependency pytest gate initially used `/usr/bin/python` because GitHub Actions starts each step in a fresh shell.
- The system Python did not provide pytest.
- Updated the post-build verification step to restore `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` and validate its status before invoking pytest.
- The verification step now uses the LCG 102a Python 3.9.12 environment.
- The prepared-dependency pytest gate and runtime-readiness gate remain pending the corrected rerun.

##### Hosted build and runtime foundation verified

- GitHub Actions run `33168104641` passed at commit:
  - `eb59c6824fd1fafc1db2175f685a79ef2876a687`.
- Total workflow duration was 5 minutes 58 seconds.
- CernVM-FS probes passed for `atlas.cern.ch` and `sft.cern.ch`.
- Verified hosted scientific runtime:
  - Python 3.9.12;
  - ROOT and PyROOT 6.26/08;
  - LCG platform `x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt`.
- All three RooFitExtensions checkouts were acquired at revision:
  - `ba94bfcbfa4f4a4e3541ade09580399e409e8514`.
- All nested RooFitExtensions builds completed.
- `xmlAnaWSBuilder`, `quickFit`, and `workspaceCombiner` built successfully.
- The pyBumpHunter environment was created and validated.
- The complete non-destructive dependency build passed.
- Prepared-dependency gate:
  - 2 passed;
  - 11 deselected;
  - failures: 0.
- Scientific runtime-readiness gate:
  - 1 passed;
  - 2 deselected;
  - runtime: 4.13 seconds;
  - failures: 0.
- ROOT compiler include-path and C++ standard-library mismatch diagnostics remained non-fatal during the successful build.

##### Authoritative hosted characterization added

- Added execution of the existing authoritative J100/J50 scientific characterization gate after the hosted build and runtime-readiness gates.
- The workflow invokes:
  - `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`;
  - marker expression `integration and requires_root`.
- No scientific comparison or provenance validation has been weakened.
- The first hosted characterization run will determine whether the Ubuntu LCG build reproduces the canonical J100/J50 scientific results.
- The frozen reference currently records the CentOS 9 LCG Python executable path, so an exact stable-provenance mismatch may occur even if the numerical results reproduce.

##### First hosted J100 characterization failure diagnosed

- The hosted characterization gate reached the real J100 workflow.
- XMLReader completed and generated the J100 workspace.
- quickFit was invoked but did not create:
  - `FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`.
- The analysis correctly returned a nonzero status and the integration test failed.
- The failure occurred before manifest generation and frozen-reference comparison.
- Build and runtime logs showed that the dependencies were compiled with Ubuntu GCC 13.3 while the selected LCG platform is `x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt`.
- ROOT also reported an inability to extract GCC 11 standard-library include paths and a possible C++ standard-library mismatch.
- Added failure-only diagnostics to the hosted characterization step.
- On failure, the workflow now prints:
  - available compiler commands and versions;
  - all generated quickFit logs;
  - any generated fit-result and fit-parameter files.
- The workflow preserves and returns the original characterization failure status.
- No scientific acceptance or provenance validation was weakened.

##### Hosted compiler toolchain aligned with LCG

- Expanded failure diagnostics confirmed that the Ubuntu 24.04 runner provided GCC and G++ 13.3.0.
- The selected LCG platform expects the GCC 11 toolchain.
- `x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-11` was unavailable.
- The generated quickFit log was empty and no fit-result files were created, indicating failure during early executable or ROOT initialization.
- Added installation of `gcc-11` and `g++-11` before CernVM-FS setup.
- Added explicit checks that both installed compilers report major version 11.
- Added a check that `x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-11` is available.
- Set the hosted job environment:
  - `CC=gcc-11`;
  - `CXX=g++-11`.
- This aligns dependency compilation with the `x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt` LCG platform and provides the compiler executable ROOT attempts to invoke.
- The authoritative J100/J50 characterization gate remains pending the GCC 11 hosted rerun.

##### Hosted quickFit executable diagnostics expanded

- Installing GCC 11 provided `x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-11`, but the hosted J100 quickFit invocation still exited before producing output.
- The redirected quickFit log remained empty and no fit-result files were created.
- Added failure-only diagnostics for:
  - compilers recorded in each dependency CMake cache;
  - quickFit executable metadata;
  - dynamic-library resolution through `ldd`;
  - a bounded direct `quickFit --help` startup probe;
  - the direct startup-probe exit status.
- Existing compiler, quickFit-log, and generated-fit-file diagnostics remain enabled.
- The characterization gate continues to return its original failing status.
- No scientific acceptance criteria were changed.

##### Portable quickFit redirection implemented

- Raw Unicode code-point inspection confirmed that the quickFit command used the Bash-specific `&>` redirection operator.
- The command is executed through `subprocess.call(..., shell=True)`, which uses `/bin/sh` rather than guaranteeing Bash.
- On the GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner, `/bin/sh` did not apply the intended combined stdout and stderr redirection.
- This allowed the shell command to return before the expected quickFit output and log files were created.
- Replaced the Bash-specific operator with portable POSIX-compatible redirection:
  - `> quickFitLog.log 2>&1`.
- Added regression coverage that verifies:
  - portable stdout and stderr redirection is present;
  - the Bash-specific combined-redirection operator is absent.
- Raw code-point inspection verified the resulting redirection characters unambiguously.
- Focused regression result:
  - 1 passed;
  - 47 deselected.
- Complete `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` result:
  - 48 passed.
- Ruff passed for `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
- Black passed for `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` with no changes required.
- `python/run_anaFit.py` compiled successfully.
- Six existing invalid-escape `SyntaxWarning` messages remain in legacy code and are unrelated to this correction.
- The authoritative hosted J100/J50 characterization gate remains pending rerun.

##### Hosted J100/J50 scientific results reproduced

- The portable quickFit redirection correction allowed both authoritative workflows to complete on the GitHub-hosted runner.
- J100 and J50 created their required fit-result and fit-parameter artifacts.
- The hosted results reproduced the canonical fit parameters and chi-square p-values.
- The characterization comparison reached the final provenance check.
- The only difference was the scientific Python executable path:
  - LXPlus baseline: `x86_64-centos9-gcc11-opt/bin/python`;
  - GitHub-hosted runtime: `x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt/bin/python`.
- Python remained version 3.9.12.
- ROOT and PyROOT remained version 6.26/08.
- Tool revisions, input hashes, configuration hashes, invocation settings, fit parameters, and p-values matched the frozen reference.
- Added an explicit allowlist containing only the CentOS 9 and Ubuntu 22.04 LCG 102a Python executable paths.
- Added `ANAFIT_EXPECTED_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` support to the integration test.
- The environment override is rejected unless it exactly matches one of the approved paths.
- When no override is supplied, the existing frozen CentOS 9 reference remains unchanged.
- Configured the hosted workflow to select the approved Ubuntu LCG Python executable.
- Exact comparison of all remaining provenance and scientific values remains unchanged.
- Ruff and Black passed for the updated integration test.
- Final hosted characterization verification remains pending rerun.

##### Final GitHub-hosted scientific verification

GitHub Actions run `33173767689` completed successfully.

Complete workflow:

- Status: passed.
- Total duration: 7 minutes 51 seconds.
- GitHub-hosted runner: Ubuntu 24.04.
- Scientific LCG platform: `x86_64-ubuntu2204-gcc11-opt`.
- Scientific Python: 3.9.12.
- ROOT and PyROOT: 6.26/08.
- Compiler: GCC and G++ 11.

The workflow successfully completed:

- recursive checkout of the four pinned top-level dependencies;
- acquisition of the three pinned RooFitExtensions checkouts;
- CernVM-FS setup and repository probes;
- read-only installation-contract validation;
- non-destructive compilation of RooFitExtensions and the three C++ dependencies;
- pyBumpHunter environment creation and validation;
- prepared-dependency verification;
- scientific runtime-readiness verification;
- authoritative J100 and J50 workflow execution;
- required fresh-artifact validation;
- schema-version-2 provenance validation;
- frozen scientific-reference comparison.

Authoritative J100/J50 characterization gate:

- 1 passed.
- 2 deselected.
- Runtime: 127.70 seconds.
- Failures: 0.
- J100 completed successfully.
- J50 completed successfully.
- Fit parameters reproduced the frozen reference.
- Chi-square p-values reproduced the frozen reference.
- Tool revisions, input hashes, configuration hashes, and invocation settings matched.
- The approved Ubuntu LCG Python executable was recorded and validated.

##### Completion status

The GitHub-hosted scientific analysis workflow is operational and passing. It provides clean hosted dependency acquisition, non-destructive dependency building, runtime verification, and complete J100/J50 scientific characterization.

The existing lightweight Python 3.12 quality workflow remains separate and unchanged.

The branch-specific push trigger remains temporary while the workflow is under review. Before final integration, review whether to retain manual execution only, add scheduled execution, or run the hosted scientific gate for selected trusted branch changes.

##### Single complete hosted test job implemented

- Expanded the passing GitHub-hosted scientific workflow into one complete test job.
- Renamed the workflow to:
  - `Complete hosted analysis test suite`.
- Renamed the job to:
  - `Complete lightweight and scientific test suite`.
- Added the locked development environment to the beginning of the same job:
  - Python 3.12.13;
  - dependencies from `requirements-dev-lock.txt`.
- Added the authoritative complete lightweight quality gate:
  - `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`.
- The single job now runs, in sequence:
  - the complete lightweight pytest suite;
  - Ruff;
  - Black;
  - scientific dependency acquisition;
  - installation-contract validation;
  - non-destructive scientific dependency building;
  - the prepared-dependency pytest gate;
  - the scientific runtime-readiness pytest gate;
  - the authoritative J100/J50 characterization pytest gate.
- The development and scientific Python environments remain separated within the job.
- The scientific steps continue to restore LCG 102a Python 3.9.12 and ROOT 6.26/08 explicitly.
- The workflow remains automatic for pushes to `github-actions-analysis` and can also be invoked manually.
- YAML syntax validation and `git diff --check` passed.
- Final execution of the expanded single job remains pending.

##### Tracked repository modifications changed from fatal to warning

- Changed scientific Git provenance collection so staged or unstaged tracked modifications no longer stop the analysis.
- `get_git_revision()` now:
  - determines the current full Git revision;
  - checks for tracked modifications;
  - prints a warning when tracked modifications are present;
  - prints the tracked Git status;
  - returns the current revision so the analysis can continue.
- Untracked files remain permitted as before.
- Failures to determine the Git revision or inspect repository status remain fatal.
- The manifest continues to record the current 40-character repository commit.
- A warning indicates that the recorded commit does not fully describe the modified working tree.
- Updated regression coverage for both staged and unstaged tracked modifications.
- Focused regression result:
  - 2 passed;
  - 46 deselected.
- Complete `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` result:
  - 48 passed.
- Ruff passed for `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
- Black passed for `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
- `python/run_anaFit.py` compiled successfully.
- Six existing invalid-escape `SyntaxWarning` messages remain in legacy code and are unrelated to this change.
- Hosted verification of the revised provenance behavior remains pending.

##### README installation and validation instructions corrected

- Replaced the unsafe sourced installer command:
  - `. install.sh`
- Documented the supported non-destructive build command:
  - `bash install.sh --build`
- Added an explicit warning that sourcing `install.sh` can terminate the active shell when the installer reaches an `exit` command.
- Reformatted the installation, setup, run, file, and validation instructions as structured Markdown.
- Replaced the outdated quality-check description with the current Tier 1 and Tier 2 validation model.
- Documented the locked Python development-environment setup.
- Documented the authoritative complete lightweight quality command:
  - `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
- Added links to:
  - `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`;
  - `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`;
  - `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`.
- `git diff --check` passed.

#### 2026-09-01: GitHub-hosted analysis branch merged into tier-2-m365

##### Merge completed

- Merged `github-actions-analysis` into `tier-2-m365` using an explicit merge commit.

##### Current status

The local `tier-2-m365` branch contains the verified merge and is ahead of `origin/tier-2-m365`. The merged target branch has not yet been pushed.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 pre-flight baseline (Chunk 0)

### Objective

Begin executing `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`. Per the plan's Chunk 0,
prove the branch is in the fully-passing state the plan's Section 2
baseline claims before any Tier 3 extraction PR is opened, so any later
gate failure can be attributed to a Tier 3 change and not to a
pre-existing condition.

### Branch

- Created `tier-3-completion` from `tier-3-claude` at commit `5cb6a32`
  (`updated workflow to current branch`).
- Committed `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` as `3f025cc` (`Add Tier 3
  completion plan`) — the plan document only; no production code changed.
- Two pre-existing, unrelated local modifications carried over from
  `tier-3-claude` (`.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml`) remain uncommitted and
  untouched; they are out of Tier 3 scope and were not staged.

### Pre-change state

Per the plan's Section 2 baseline: Tier 1 and Tier 2 are complete and
verified on this branch's ancestry; `python/run_anaFit.py` is still a
single 901-line module; no Tier 3 extraction has begun.

### Verification performed

All three gates from `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Section 7, run with
nothing else staged, at commit `3f025cc`:

1. `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
   - Tests collected: 122; selected: 120; passed: 120; prepared-dependency
     tests deselected: 2; unexpected failures: 0.
   - Ruff: passed. Black: passed (8 files unchanged).
   - Six pre-existing legacy `SyntaxWarning` messages in `run_anaFit.py`
     (invalid escape sequences), unrelated to this baseline, unchanged
     from prior entries.
   - Exit code: 0.

2. `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
   - 2 passed, 11 deselected.
   - Exit code: 0.

3. `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
   - Real authoritative J100/J50 rerun from fresh isolated output
     directories, fresh schema-version-2 manifests, tolerance-aware
     frozen-reference comparison.
   - 1 passed, 2 deselected, runtime 126.12s.
   - Exit code: 0.

- `git status -sb`: only the two pre-existing, unrelated workflow-file
  modifications noted above; no untracked artifacts left by test
  execution.
- `git diff --check`: passed (exit 0).

### Current status

The Chunk 0 baseline is established and fully passing. `tier-3-completion`
is ready for Chunk 1 (`run_execution.py`) PR A (characterization tests for
`execute`/`execute_required`, no production-code changes) per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`.

### Remaining open chunks

All of Chunks 1 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open.
None has started.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 1.A: characterization tests for `execute`/`execute_required`

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `execute()` and
`execute_required()` in `python/run_anaFit.py` before extracting them into
`run_execution.py`, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 1.

### Pre-change state

`execute_required()` already had four direct tests
(`test_execute_required_accepts_success_with_expected_output`,
`test_execute_required_rejects_stale_expected_output`,
`test_execute_required_rejects_nonzero_command_status`,
`test_execute_required_rejects_missing_expected_output`), but every one of
them replaces `execute` itself via `monkeypatch.setattr(module, "execute",
...)` before calling anything. `execute()` — the function that actually
prints `"EXECUTE: {cmd}"` and calls `subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)` —
had never been called for real by any existing test.

### Target functions — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `execute(cmd)` | `cmd: str` | `int` (subprocess return code) | runs `cmd` via `subprocess.call(shell=True)`; prints `"EXECUTE: {cmd}"` |
| `execute_required(cmd, description, expected_outputs=())` | `cmd: str`, `description: str`, `expected_outputs: Sequence[str]` | `bool` | deletes any pre-existing `expected_outputs` before running; prints error diagnostics on failure |

### Tests added

- `test_execute_returns_the_real_subprocess_return_code` — calls the real
  `execute()` with `"exit 0"` and `"exit 3"`, asserts the return value is
  the shell's actual exit code both times (not a boolean or a hardcoded
  value).
- `test_execute_prints_the_command_before_running_it` — calls the real
  `execute("echo hello")` with `capsys` capturing stdout, asserts both
  `"EXECUTE: echo hello"` (the function's own print) and `"hello"` (the
  child process's own output) are present, proving a real subprocess ran.

### What this PR does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py`
was empty throughout this change — only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` was
touched.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -k execute -v` → 6 passed
  (the 4 existing `execute_required` tests plus the 2 new `execute`
  tests).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q` → 50 passed (full-file
  regression check).
- `python -m ruff check tests/test_run_anaFit.py` → passed.
- `python -m black --check tests/test_run_anaFit.py` → passed, unchanged.
- `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py` → empty.
- A manual, uncaptured replay of the same three `execute()` calls
  (`exit 0`, `exit 3`, `echo hello`) was run directly against the loaded
  module to trace exactly what each assertion checks, independent of
  pytest's own output capturing.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Base commit for these tests: `365460e` (Chunk 0 baseline) — matches the
   file's state at the time the tests were written; `run_anaFit.py` was
   not touched afterward either.
2. Every new test asserts a real output/side-effect (return-code
   passthrough for two distinct exit codes; two distinct printed strings),
   not just "no exception."
3. `git diff --stat` shows no production file touched.
4. Tests were run and read by the user (repository owner), not only
   reported passing by the author.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: confirmed by the user in this session
   ("i agree lets continue") after reviewing the test code, the manual
   trace of `execute()`'s real output, and a full line-by-line walkthrough
   of both new tests and the shared `_load_run_anafit_module` helper.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 1.B (extraction of `run_execution.py`) and Chunks 2 through 12 are
open.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 1.B: extract `run_execution.py`

### Objective

Move `execute()` and `execute_required()`, characterized in Chunk 1.A
(commit `7029a46`), out of `python/run_anaFit.py` into a new
`python/run_execution.py`, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 1.

### What changed

- `python/run_execution.py` created, containing `execute()` and
  `execute_required()` moved verbatim from `python/run_anaFit.py`
  (identical bodies; only the `os`/`subprocess`/`sys` imports they
  actually need were added at module top level), then formatted with
  `python -m black python/run_execution.py` once it was added to the
  Tier 2 target list (one whitespace-only change: a list comprehension
  collapsed to one line — no logic change).
- `python/run_anaFit.py`: the two function definitions removed; replaced
  with `from run_execution import execute, execute_required` (flat
  sibling-import style, matching the file's existing
  `from ExtractPostfitFromWS import PostfitExtractor`-style imports and
  how Python resolves imports when the script is run directly in
  production). Every existing call site (`execute_required(...)` in the
  XMLReader/quickFit/BumpHunter paths, `execute(...)` for the `.dtd`
  symlink, `plot_edm.py`, the resolution-binning generator, and the
  `quickLimit` call) is unchanged — only the definitions moved, not the
  call sites.
- `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`: added a blocking prerequisite fix to
  `_load_run_anafit_module` — `monkeypatch.syspath_prepend(str(module_path.parent))`
  before `exec_module`, so the file can resolve `run_anaFit.py`'s new
  `from run_execution import ...` line the same way Python's interpreter
  already does automatically in production (the script's own directory is
  auto-added to `sys.path` when run directly; loading via
  `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` does not get that for free).
  Confirmed this was in fact required: adding the import before this fix
  reproduced the exact `ModuleNotFoundError` the plan predicted.
- `tests/test_run_execution.py` created: the six relocated tests, using
  the plain `from python import run_execution` style (no `ROOT`/sibling
  stubbing needed — this module touches neither).
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `python/run_execution.py` to
  `python_targets` and `tests/test_run_execution.py` to `test_targets`.

### A real integration issue the acceptance check caught

Relocating the tests was not a purely mechanical import-line swap. The
four original `execute_required` tests patch `execute` via
`monkeypatch.setattr(module, "execute", fake)`, where `module` was the
loaded `run_anaFit` module. Before this chunk, `execute_required` and
`execute` were defined in the *same* module, so patching `execute` there
correctly intercepted `execute_required`'s internal call. After the move,
`execute_required` lives in `run_execution.py` and looks up `execute` in
*that* module's own globals — patching the old location (`module.execute`
on the loaded `run_anaFit` object) no longer reaches it. Running the tests
immediately after moving the code (before relocating the tests) reproduced
this exactly: `test_execute_required_accepts_success_with_expected_output`
failed with `/bin/sh: line 1: analysis: command not found` (exit 127),
because `execute_required` was calling the real, unpatched `execute`. The
relocated tests in `tests/test_run_execution.py` patch
`run_execution.execute` directly instead — the correct target now that
both functions share that module's namespace — and all six pass. This
required changing more than the Test Relocation Rule's "import statement
only" baseline (the monkeypatch *target* and the direct-call *receiver*
also changed from `module.X` to `run_execution.X`), but no assertion,
fixture value, or expected outcome was altered — the correction is a
necessary consequence of the functions changing which module's namespace
they live in, not a hidden behavior change.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`execute()`/`execute_required()`'s bodies are byte-for-byte identical to
before the move (aside from Black's one whitespace-only reformat, applied
after the move). Every call site in `run_anaFit.py` is untouched.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_execution.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 6 + 44 = 50 passed (same total as before the move: the six execute
  tests moved out of `test_run_anaFit.py`, into `test_run_execution.py`,
  net count unchanged).
- `grep -n "^def execute\b\|^def execute_required\b" python/run_anaFit.py`
  → no output (definitions fully removed).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 122 passed, 2
  deselected; Ruff passed; Black passed (after the one-file reformat
  above); exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
  → 2 passed, 11 deselected.
- `git status -sb` → only this chunk's five changed/new files, plus the
  two pre-existing unrelated workflow-file modifications carried over
  since Chunk 0.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- No integration-gate rerun performed for this chunk — Chunk 1 does not
  touch a real branch condition or template-generation logic (unlike
  Chunks 4, 5, 8, where it is mandatory), only relocates two
  already-isolated pure functions.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 1, PR B (this entry).
2. PR A is merged (`7029a46`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are not import-line-only, as noted above — the
   monkeypatch target and call receiver also changed, explicitly because
   the code moved between module namespaces; no assertion or expected
   value changed.
5. New/moved functions are all covered (relocated tests + no new
   functions were introduced this chunk).
6. Confirmed by grep: `run_anaFit.py` actually imports and never
   redefines `execute`/`execute_required`.
7. Only the six intended files were staged for this chunk (the two
   pre-existing workflow-file diffs remain unstaged, not part of this
   commit).
8. All required Section 7 gates ran and passed, output captured above.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunks 2 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 2 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open. Chunk 1
(both PR A and PR B) is complete and verified.

## 2026-09-02: Chunk 1.B supplementary verification — authoritative J100/J50 gate

### Objective

`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Section 7 does not list the integration
gate as mandatory for Chunk 1 (only Chunks 4, 5, 8, and before 12). At the
user's explicit request, run it anyway after Chunk 1.B (commit `c68585b`)
as extra confidence, since real production code did change — including
the exact import mechanism (`from run_execution import execute,
execute_required`) that only gets exercised for real when the launcher
scripts invoke `run_anaFit.py` directly as a script, not through the test
suite's simulated `sys.path` fix.

### Verification performed

Command: `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Result:

- 1 passed, 2 deselected.
- Runtime: 168.02s.
- Both J100 and J50 reran from fresh isolated output directories using
  the real authoritative launcher scripts.
- Fresh schema-version-2 manifests generated and validated.
- Fit parameters and chi-square p-values matched the frozen reference
  within the established tolerances.
- Exit code: 0.

`git status -sb` after the run: only the two pre-existing, unrelated
workflow-file modifications carried since Chunk 0; no untracked artifacts
left by the run. `git diff --check`: passed.

### Current status

Chunk 1's extraction is now confirmed both by the fast unit-test gate
(recorded in the Chunk 1.B entry above) and by a real end-to-end rerun of
the actual production launcher scripts — the new module boundary and
import mechanism work correctly outside the test harness, not only inside
it. No scientific result changed.

## 2026-09-02: Housekeeping — remove duplicate `subprocess` import in `python/run_anaFit.py`

### Objective

Fix a pre-existing duplicate import identified by the user during review
of Chunk 1.B: `python/run_anaFit.py` imported `subprocess` twice — once as
part of the combined `import os,sys,re,argparse,subprocess,shutil` line,
and again as a standalone `import subprocess` line immediately before
`import ROOT`. This predates Tier 3 (present in the original,
unmodified file); Chunk 1.B's edit happened to touch the surrounding
lines (replacing the old `execute`/`execute_required` definitions with
`from run_execution import execute, execute_required`) without removing
the pre-existing duplicate.

### Change

Removed the standalone `import subprocess` line. The combined import on
line 4 already provides it; `subprocess.run(...)` (used in
`get_git_revision`, two call sites) is otherwise unaffected. Zero
behavior change — Python treats a duplicate `import` as a harmless no-op,
so this is a pure readability fix, not a bug fix.

### Verification performed

- `python -m py_compile python/run_anaFit.py` → compiles (only the six
  pre-existing, unrelated legacy `SyntaxWarning` messages remain).
- `grep -n "^import subprocess\|subprocess\."` confirms exactly one
  import and both existing `subprocess.run(...)` call sites unchanged.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py tests/test_run_execution.py -q`
  → 50 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 122 passed, 2
  deselected, Ruff/Black clean, exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed, 164.10s, frozen reference reproduced exactly.
- `git status -sb` → only `python/run_anaFit.py` touched (1 line
  removed); `git diff --check` passed.

### Current status

This is a standalone housekeeping fix, not tied to a specific
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` chunk. All chunk status is unchanged:
Chunks 2 through 12 remain open.

## 2026-09-02: Persist repository dirty state in schema-version-2 provenance (code + tests)

### Objective

Address a GitHub Copilot review finding on `python/run_anaFit.py`'s
`get_git_revision()`: when the main repository has tracked modifications,
the function prints a console warning and continues, but
`analysis_results.json` still records only `repository_commit`, with no
persisted, machine-verifiable indication that the tree was dirty at
generation time. Once the warning scrolls off, a manifest looks like a
clean, fully-provenance-tracked result even when it wasn't.

This is not new: an earlier Copilot review (2026-08-27, "Copilot
merge-review safety corrections") made dirty tracked trees **fatal**; that
was deliberately relaxed to a warning-only path the same day
("Tracked repository modifications changed from fatal to warning") to
avoid blocking the hosted CI environment. Copilot is now correctly
pointing out that the warning-only path never actually fixed the
underlying provenance-integrity gap it was already known to create — it
only stopped it from being fatal. This change resolves that gap properly:
keep the analysis non-fatal on a dirty tree (preserving the CI
compatibility the 2026-08-27 relaxation was for), but persist the dirty
state as a first-class, validated field in the manifest.

### Scope decision: main repository only, not the four pinned tool checkouts

`get_git_revision()` is also called for `xmlAnaWSBuilder`, `quickFit`,
`workspaceCombiner`, and `pyBumpHunter`. Their dirty state is **not**
added to the provenance schema, because it is already covered by an
existing, dedicated, always-run check:
`tests/test_repo_utils.py::test_external_dependency_checkouts_have_no_tracked_source_changes`
(part of the `requires_analysis_dependencies` gate). Duplicating that
signal inside the provenance payload would be redundant. `tool_revisions`
therefore keeps its existing shape (`dict[str, str]`) unchanged.

### Changes completed

- `python/run_anaFit.py`:
  - `get_git_revision()` now returns `(revision, dirty)` instead of just
    `revision`. The warning-and-continue behavior is unchanged; `dirty`
    is simply the boolean the function already computed to decide whether
    to print the warning.
  - `build_analysis_provenance()` unpacks the main repository's
    `(repository_commit, repository_dirty)` and adds `repository_dirty`
    as a new top-level key in the returned payload. The four tool-checkout
    calls now take `get_git_revision(path)[0]`, discarding their dirty
    flag per the scope decision above.
- `python/analysis_reference.py`:
  - `_validate_analysis_provenance()`: `repository_dirty` added to
    `required_keys` and validated as a boolean.
  - `_build_workflow_payload()`: `repository_dirty` is popped from the
    "stable" provenance used for the frozen-reference comparison,
    alongside the existing `repository_commit` pop — same
    self-referential-identity reasoning: both fields describe the specific
    run instance, not the scientific result, so neither belongs in a
    cross-run/cross-environment comparison. **This means the frozen
    reference (`tests/references/analysis_reference.json`) requires no
    change** — it never included `repository_commit` and correspondingly
    never includes `repository_dirty`.
- `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`:
  - Updated `test_get_git_revision_returns_clean_repository_commit`,
    `test_get_git_revision_warns_for_tracked_modifications` (both
    parametrized cases), and `test_get_git_revision_ignores_untracked_files`
    to unpack the new `(revision, dirty)` return value and assert the
    correct `dirty` boolean for each case (clean, staged/unstaged dirty,
    untracked-only).
  - Updated `test_build_analysis_provenance_records_runtime_inputs_tools_and_invocation`'s
    stub and expected payload to include `repository_dirty: False`.
  - Added `test_build_analysis_provenance_records_dirty_repository_state`:
    asserts that when the main repository is dirty but all four tool
    checkouts are clean, the payload records `repository_dirty: True`
    while `tool_revisions` correctly contains only revision strings with
    no leaked dirty state.
- `tests/test_analysis_reference.py`:
  - `_valid_analysis_provenance()` fixture updated with
    `"repository_dirty": False`.
  - `test_analysis_reference_comparison_rejects_provenance_drift` updated
    to pop `repository_dirty` alongside `repository_commit` from both
    sides, matching the production exclusion above.
  - `test_validate_analysis_provenance_accepts_complete_payload` asserts
    `repository_dirty is False`.
  - `test_validate_analysis_provenance_rejects_invalid_payload` gained a
    new parametrized case: a non-boolean `repository_dirty` value is
    rejected with `"repository_dirty must be boolean"`.

### Known, expected, temporary failure at this exact commit

`tests/test_analysis_reference.py::test_analysis_reference_matches_frozen_output`
calls `build_analysis_reference()` with no `repo_root` override, i.e.
against the **real, tracked** `run/fits/J100/.../analysis_results.json`
and `run/fits/J50/.../analysis_results.json` files. Those files were
generated by the pre-change code and do not yet have `repository_dirty`,
so `_validate_analysis_provenance()` now correctly rejects them as missing
a required key. This is the exact ordering problem the 2026-08-21
schema-version-2 rollout and the 2026-08-27 "Canonical manifest provenance
corrected" entry already hit and solved the same way: commit the code
first, then regenerate the two canonical manifests from that clean commit,
then commit the regenerated manifests separately. That regeneration is the
immediately following activity-log entry, not deferred.

### Verification performed

- `python -m py_compile python/run_anaFit.py python/analysis_reference.py`
  → compiles (same six pre-existing, unrelated legacy `SyntaxWarning`
  messages).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -k "git_revision or build_analysis_provenance" -v`
  → 7 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q` → 45 passed (44 + 1 new
  test).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py -v` → **44 passed, 1
  failed** (`test_analysis_reference_matches_frozen_output`, explained
  above — every other test, including the four new/updated provenance
  validation cases, passes).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → **123 passed, 1 failed,
  2 deselected**, same single expected failure; Ruff and Black were run
  separately against every touched file
  (`python/run_execution.py`, `tests/test_run_execution.py`,
  `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`, `python/analysis_reference.py`,
  `tests/test_analysis_reference.py`) since the gate's own Ruff/Black
  steps don't run after a pytest failure: both passed, no changes needed.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- No integration-gate rerun yet — it is run as part of manifest
  regeneration in the next entry, since that rerun *is* the regeneration.

### Remaining open work

Regenerate and commit the two canonical manifests (immediately following
entry). Until that lands, `quality_check.py --mode full` is expected to
show exactly the one failure described above — this is not an unrelated
regression if seen at this specific commit.

## 2026-09-02: Canonical manifest provenance regenerated for repository_dirty

### Objective

Resolve the known, expected failure left by the previous entry
(`test_analysis_reference_matches_frozen_output`) by regenerating the two
canonical J100/J50 manifests from the clean commit that introduced
`repository_dirty` (`a83e888`), matching the established
2026-08-27 "Canonical manifest provenance corrected" precedent for this
exact kind of schema change.

### Procedure

- Confirmed the working tree was clean at commit `a83e888` before
  execution (`git status -sb`).
- Ran both authoritative launchers into a fresh, isolated temporary output
  root (`ANAFIT_OUTPUT_DIR`), with `ANAFIT_SKIP_PLOTS=1`:
  - `bash scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` — completed successfully, 2m1s,
    `p(chi2)=0.018` printed.
  - `bash scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh` — completed successfully, 1m36s,
    `p(chi2)=0.079` printed.
- Inspected both fresh `analysis_results.json` manifests before promoting
  them: both recorded `"repository_commit": "a83e888c59bb..."` (exact
  match for the commit used), `"repository_dirty": false` (correctly
  clean), `p_chi2` values exactly matching the frozen reference
  (`0.018448750724012808` and `0.07853114301666252`), and every other
  provenance field (tool revisions, input/configuration hashes,
  invocation settings) unchanged from the previously committed manifests.
- Copied only the two regenerated `analysis_results.json` files into their
  canonical tracked locations, overwriting the previous ones. No other
  tracked scientific artifact was touched. Confirmed via `git diff
  --stat`: exactly 2 files, 3 lines each
  (`repository_commit` value changed, `repository_dirty` line added).

### Verification performed

- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → **124 passed, 2
  deselected**, exit code 0 (the previously-failing test now passes).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed, 190.39s. Both J100 and J50 reran from fresh isolated
  outputs a second time (independent of the regeneration run above) and
  matched the frozen reference within tolerance — confirming the
  regenerated canonical manifests are consistent with a completely
  independent fresh run, not just self-consistent with themselves.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
  → 2 passed, 11 deselected.
- `git status -sb` → only the two manifest files; no untracked artifacts.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Current status

The Copilot-flagged provenance gap is fully resolved and verified:
`analysis_results.json` now persists a validated, machine-checkable
`repository_dirty` field for every future run, the two canonical
manifests reflect the current clean commit, and every established gate
(lightweight, dependency, and the real scientific characterization gate)
passes. This closes the finding; no further Tier 3 chunk work is implied
or affected by this change. Chunks 2 through 12 remain open.

## 2026-09-02: Propagate scientific setup failures instead of silently continuing

### Objective

Address a second GitHub Copilot review finding, on
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` lines 12-14: `source
"${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh"`, `lsetup "views
LCG_102a ..."`, and `lsetup cmake` had no exit-status check. Because every
caller that sources this script deliberately disables `errexit` first
(required, since ATLAS's own setup machinery isn't nounset/errexit-safe —
see the 2026-08-28 "ATLAS setup errexit compatibility corrected" entry), a
failed setup command was silently followed by the script's remaining
`export`/`mkdir` lines succeeding, so the sourced script still returned 0
overall. A caller checking that return code would see success and
potentially build or fit against the host environment instead of the
pinned LCG_102a view.

### Scope: both branches, and the two callers that don't check the sourcing's own exit status

Reading the complete file (not just the three lines Copilot's comment
quoted) found the identical pattern in the `else` branch (the *default*
LXPlus path used whenever `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM` is unset — the path this
very development session has been exercising on lxplus975 all along, not
just the hosted-CI override path Copilot's comment happened to point at):
`source setup_lxplus.sh` for both `xmlAnaWSBuilder` and `quickFit` had the
same unguarded-failure problem.

Separately, guarding `setup_buildAndFit.sh` alone is necessary but not
sufficient: `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` and `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`
have no `set -e` anywhere and never checked the exit status of `.
"$setup_script"` — so even a correctly-`return 1`-ing setup script would
have been silently ignored by the two authoritative launchers, which is
exactly the concern Copilot's own wording ("The workflow then treats a
failed scientific setup as successful") points at. The hosted CI
workflow (`.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`) already checks
this correctly (`setup_status=$?` after each `source
scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`, per the same 2026-08-28 precedent) and did
not need changing.

### Changes completed

- `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`:
  - `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM` branch: `source atlasLocalSetup.sh`, both
    `lsetup` calls now `|| return 1`.
  - Default LXPlus branch: `source setup_lxplus.sh` (both
    `xmlAnaWSBuilder` and `quickFit`) now has its exit status captured
    explicitly and checked *after* the following `cd .. || return 1` —
    not `|| return 1` directly on the `source` line, which would have
    returned before restoring the working directory, leaving the calling
    shell inside `xmlAnaWSBuilder/`/`quickFit/` on failure. Verified this
    ordering matters: an earlier draft of this fix using the naive `||
    return 1` form was caught by a directory-restoration test before being
    corrected (see Tests below).
  - Verified the success path is unaffected: sourced the corrected script
    directly on this LXPlus session (the same default branch every
    integration-gate run in this session has been exercising) — exit
    status 0, `_DIRXMLWSBUILDER`/`_DIRFIT` both correctly exported, `pwd`
    correctly back at the repository root afterward.
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`, `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`: added a
  `setup_status=$?` check immediately after `. "$setup_script"`, printing
  an error and exiting with that status on failure — the exact same idiom
  already used later in both scripts for `run_anaFit.py`'s own
  `analysis_status`.

### Tests added

- `test_setup_build_and_fit_propagates_setup_lxplus_failure_and_restores_cwd`
  (new, first direct test of `setup_buildAndFit.sh` itself — no prior
  test exercised its own logic in isolation): sources the real script
  against an isolated fake directory tree with a deliberately-failing
  `xmlAnaWSBuilder/setup_lxplus.sh`, asserts the source reports exit
  status 1 **and** that the calling shell's working directory is
  correctly restored, not left inside `xmlAnaWSBuilder/`. Caught the
  cwd-leak regression described above during development of this fix.
- `test_launcher_propagates_setup_failure_before_running_analysis`
  (new, parametrized over both launchers, mirroring the existing
  `test_launcher_propagates_analysis_failure_before_plotting` pattern):
  stubs `ANAFIT_SETUP_SCRIPT` with a script that fails, asserts the
  launcher exits with that failure code and that the (separately stubbed)
  analysis runner is never invoked and no plot output is produced.

A note on a test-authoring pitfall hit and fixed while writing the first
new test: the fake failing `setup_lxplus.sh` initially used `exit 1`.
Because `setup_lxplus.sh` is always *sourced*, never executed, `exit`
terminates the entire calling shell rather than just the source
operation — which silently killed the whole test harness process instead
of exercising the intended failure path. Confirmed the real external
`xmlAnaWSBuilder/setup_lxplus.sh` and `quickFit/setup_lxplus.sh` already
correctly use `return 1`, and fixed the fake fixture to match.

### Verification performed

- `bash -n` on all three changed scripts → syntax OK.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -k "setup_build_and_fit or launcher" -v`
  → 7 passed (2 new + 5 existing, all unaffected).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q` → 48 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 127 passed, 2
  deselected, Ruff/Black clean, exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -v -m "requires_root or integration"`
  → **2 passed**, 238.75s: both the authoritative J100/J50
  characterization gate (real rerun, frozen reference reproduced) and
  `test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime` (which directly
  sources the now-corrected `setup_buildAndFit.sh` to establish the real
  scientific environment) passed — confirming the fix does not break real
  environment setup, only closes the silent-failure gap.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
  → 2 passed, 11 deselected.
- `git status -sb` → only the four intended files; `git diff --check`
  passed.

### Current status

Both GitHub Copilot findings raised on this PR are now resolved and
verified. This change is standalone, not tied to a `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
chunk. Chunks 2 through 12 remain open.

## 2026-09-02: Correct wrong PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM branch

### Objective

Address a third GitHub Copilot review finding, on
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` lines 18-21: the `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM`
branch exported `_BIN_PATH="${_DIRXMLWSBUILDER}/bin"` and
`_LIB_PATH="${_DIRXMLWSBUILDER}/lib"`, but `install.sh` actually builds
XMLReader and `libxmlAnaWSBuilder.so` into `xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/bin` and
`xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/lib`.

### Independent verification of the claim (not taken on faith)

Directly inspected the real checkout before changing anything:

- `xmlAnaWSBuilder/bin/` — **does not exist**.
- `xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/bin/XMLReader` — the real, built executable.
- `xmlAnaWSBuilder/lib/` — exists and holds the copied
  `libRooFitExtensions.so` (a real, separate dependency — this is the
  directory Copilot's suggested fix correctly retains rather than
  discards).
- `xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/lib/libxmlAnaWSBuilder.so` — the real library,
  entirely absent from the old `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Copilot's finding and suggested fix (union both lib directories, point
bin at `build/bin`) were both confirmed correct.

### The identical, unflagged bug in the parallel quickFit block

Reading the whole file (not just the quoted lines) found the same pattern
one block down, for `quickFit`, which Copilot's comment did not mention:
`_BIN_PATH="${_DIRFIT}/bin"` (exists but is **empty**) and
`_LIB_PATH="${_DIRFIT}/lib"` (has `libRooFitExtensions.so` but not
`libquick.so`). quickFit's actual build output is flat in `quickFit/build/`
(`quickFit`, `quickLimit`, `quickAsimov`, `libquick.so` all sit directly
there, confirmed via `ls` and via `install.sh`'s own build-verification
step), not nested under `build/bin`/`build/lib` the way xmlAnaWSBuilder is.
Fixed with the equivalent, layout-adjusted correction.

### Impact analysis — precise, not assumed

Before concluding this was purely defensive, checked what actually
depends on the broken values:

- `readelf -d` on the real built `XMLReader`/`quickFit` binaries shows
  both have **RPATH baked in** at build time (absolute paths into this
  checkout's own `build/lib` / `build` and `RooFitExtensions/build`), and
  `ldd` confirms both resolve their own shared libraries via that RPATH
  already. So on this checkout, the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` gap was likely
  inert for XMLReader/quickFit specifically — and `run_anaFit.py` invokes
  both via **hardcoded relative paths**
  (`xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/bin/XMLReader`, `quickFit/build/quickFit`), so
  the broken `PATH` never mattered for those two either.
- `quickLimit` is different: `run_anaFit.py` invokes it via a **bare
  command name** (`execute("quickLimit -f ...")`, `python/run_anaFit.py:782`,
  no path prefix at all) — this genuinely depends on `PATH` alone to find
  `quickFit/build/quickLimit`. Under the old, broken
  `_BIN_PATH="${_DIRFIT}/bin"` (empty directory), any `dolimit=True` run
  under `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM` would have failed with "command not found."
  This was never caught by the passing hosted CI run because the
  canonical J100/J50 background-only gate always has `dolimit=False` and
  never exercises `quickLimit`.

This is reported precisely rather than claiming the fix "unbroke the
hosted pipeline" (it likely didn't, for the tested background-only path)
or dismissing the finding as harmless (it was a real, silent gap for the
untested `dolimit=True` path, exactly the kind of defect Copilot review
exists to surface before it's hit in practice).

### Changes completed

- `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`:
  - `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM` branch: `_BIN_PATH`/`_LIB_PATH` corrected for
    both `xmlAnaWSBuilder` (`build/bin`; `build/lib:lib`) and `quickFit`
    (`build`; `build:lib`, since quickFit's build output has no nested
    `bin`/`lib`).
  - `ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE` changed from unconditionally hardcoded to
    `"${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE:-/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase}"`
    — honors an existing value instead of always overwriting it. This is
    what makes the new test below possible at all: it is the same
    override-if-unset convention already used throughout this repo's
    scripts (`ANAFIT_SETUP_SCRIPT`, `ANAFIT_RUNNER`, `ANAFIT_OUTPUT_DIR`,
    etc.), applied here for the same reason. Zero behavior change in
    production, where this variable is never pre-set.

### Tests added

- `test_setup_build_and_fit_lcg_platform_branch_exposes_build_directories`
  (new): exercises the **real** `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM` branch end-to-end,
  using a fake `ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE` tree containing a stub
  `atlasLocalSetup.sh` that defines a no-op `lsetup` function (avoids
  needing genuine CVMFS/Ubuntu infrastructure, which isn't available on
  this lxplus session for this specific platform branch). Asserts the
  resulting `PATH` contains the real `xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/bin` and
  `quickFit/build` directories, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` contains all four real
  library directories (`xmlAnaWSBuilder/build/lib`, `xmlAnaWSBuilder/lib`,
  `quickFit/build`, `quickFit/lib`), and explicitly that the old, wrong
  `xmlAnaWSBuilder/bin` path never reappears.

### Verification performed

- `bash -n scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` → syntax OK.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -k "setup_build_and_fit or launcher" -v`
  → 8 passed (1 new + 7 existing, all unaffected).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q` → 49 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 128 passed, 2
  deselected, Ruff/Black clean, exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -v -m "requires_root or integration"`
  → 2 passed, 183.14s (both the authoritative J100/J50 characterization
  gate and the runtime-readiness gate) — confirms the unchanged default
  LXPlus branch (the one actually exercised on this session's own
  environment) and the rest of the script are unaffected by this fix.
  The `ANAFIT_LCG_PLATFORM` branch itself is validated by the new
  isolated unit test above plus, going forward, the existing hosted
  `scientific-analysis.yml` workflow, which is the only environment that
  genuinely exercises that branch for real.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
  → 2 passed, 11 deselected.
- `git status -sb` → only the two intended files; `git diff --check`
  passed.

### Current status

All three GitHub Copilot findings raised on this PR are now resolved and
verified. Standalone change, not tied to a `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
chunk. Chunks 2 through 12 remain open.

## 2026-09-02: Revise the plan's PR model to match the workflow actually used

### Objective

Address a fourth GitHub Copilot review finding, on
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` guardrail 7 ("One PR = one step of one
chunk"): the actual PR opened for this branch bundles the pre-flight
baseline, Chunk 1's characterization and extraction, and several unrelated
standalone fixes together, which is exactly what guardrail 7 said never to
do. Copilot correctly identified that this means the plan's stated
mechanism for enforcing "tests written and human-verified before
production files are modified" — a separately merged characterization PR,
required before the extraction PR can even be opened — was not actually
happening.

### Root cause: the plan's guardrail 7 never matched the workflow the user chose

Earlier in this branch's history (Chunk 1's characterization checkpoint),
the user was explicitly asked whether to verify each step locally in
conversation or push a branch and open a real GitHub PR per step, and
chose local conversational verification. That choice is fundamentally
incompatible with guardrail 7's literal wording, which assumes a
separately-merged PR exists between every characterization and extraction
step. The plan document was never updated to reflect that choice at the
time it was made — this entry is that update, prompted by Copilot
correctly noticing the gap between the document and the practice.

### What was preserved vs. what changed

The safety **substance** guardrail 7 exists for was, in fact, honored for
Chunk 1: the characterization tests were reviewed (test code read, a real
unmocked trace of `execute()`'s output shown, a full line-by-line
walkthrough given) and explicitly confirmed by the user ("i agree lets
continue") *before* `run_anaFit.py` was touched. What was missing was the
GitHub **artifact** of that — a separately merged PR — not the
verification itself.

`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` is revised accordingly, offered to and
selected by the user from three options (rewrite the guardrail to match
reality; keep the guardrail and literally split into per-step PRs from
here on; retroactively split the already-open PR too). The chosen
approach:

- Section 5 ("The PR-chunk delivery model") retitled "The chunk delivery
  model," with a "Revision note" at its start explaining this exact
  history transparently, and rewritten throughout: each chunk is still
  delivered as two ordered, individually-verifiable steps (renamed
  "Step A"/"Step B" throughout the whole document, replacing "PR A"/"PR
  B"), each its own commit, but the human-verification checkpoint between
  them happens in session before Step B's commit is made, not via a
  separately merged PR. A new subsection, "What actually gets reviewed on
  GitHub," states plainly that individual steps are not each their own PR
  — work accumulates as ordered commits, and a PR is opened per chunk or
  a small labeled batch for final review, with the Step A/Step B ordering
  verifiable by reading the commit history within it.
- Guardrails 2, 3, 7, and 8 (Section 1) reworded to reference commits and
  the in-session verification checkpoint instead of PR merges.
- Section 8 retitled "Per-step compliance checklist," both checklist
  variants reworded (e.g. "is PR A merged" → "did Step A's commit precede
  this one in the branch history").
- Section 6 chunk-by-chunk text: every "PR A"/"PR B" label renamed to
  "Step A"/"Step B"; "single PR" chunk headers (0, 8, 12) renamed "single
  commit"; stray "PR content"/"PR description"/"opened and merged as its
  own tiny PR" phrasing corrected throughout.
- Section 7 and Section 9 updated similarly (gate-comment wording, the
  completion definition's "both its PRs... merged" → "both its steps'
  commits... made").

No guardrail was weakened: every substantive requirement (tests before
code, human verification of characterization before extraction, explicit
recording of that verification, append-only activity log, no scope
creep) is unchanged. Only the mechanism for the human-verification
checkpoint and the artifact structure around it changed, to describe what
this project actually does.

### Verification performed

- `grep -n "single PR\|PR's\|PR provides\|PR description\|PR content\|PR is not ready\|PR is marked\|two-PR\|characterization PR\|extraction PR\|PR A\|PR B\|PRs\b" doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
  → only two intentional, correct remaining matches (the Revision Note's
  historical reference to "the resulting single PR" Copilot reviewed, and
  "What actually gets reviewed on GitHub"'s description of the real,
  eventual PR's own commit history) — confirmed both are appropriate, not
  leftover stale wording.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` → clean.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- No code, test, or gate changes in this entry — documentation only.

### Current status

`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s process description now matches the
workflow this branch has actually been using since Chunk 1. Going
forward, chunks continue to follow the same Step A → human verification →
Step B sequence as before; only the document's account of how that gets
reviewed on GitHub changed. Chunks 2 through 12 remain open.

## 2026-09-02: Activity-log completeness audit — three missing entries backfilled

### Objective

The user asked directly whether every change on this branch had been
recorded in this log. Rather than assume yes, cross-checked every commit
on `tier-3-completion` since it branched from `tier-3-claude` (`git log
--oneline 5cb6a32..HEAD`) against every dated section header in this file.
Found three commits with no corresponding entry. This entry backfills all
three, appended here per guardrail 2 (append-only; new entries go at the
end, existing ones are never reordered or edited) — the same approach
this log's own 2026-07-29 "Activity-log correction" entry used for an
identical situation.

### Gap 1 — `3f025cc`: "Add Tier 3 completion plan"

This is the commit that added `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` itself (1,318
lines) to this branch — the authoritative, from-scratch Tier 3 execution
plan described in this file's own preceding entries. No production code
was changed. This predates the Chunk 0 baseline entry immediately
following it in this log and was the first commit made on
`tier-3-completion` after branching.

### Gap 2 — `e3379fc`: "Enable hosted CI on tier-3-completion"

Added `tier-3-completion` to the branch-trigger lists in both
`.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml` (`pull_request` trigger) and
`.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` (`push` trigger), matching the
same trigger coverage already present for `harry`, `tier-2-m365`, and
`tier-3-claude`. This commit also included a pre-existing, uncommitted
local edit (from the prior "updated workflow to current branch" session,
made by the user, not by this session) adding `tier-3-claude` to both
files and removing `tier1-root-comparison.yml`'s separate `push` trigger
for `harry`/`tier-2-m365` — both changes were already present, uncommitted,
in the working tree when this session began, and were committed together
since they touched the same lines. This commit is what made the hosted
`scientific-analysis.yml` push-triggered workflow actually run against
this branch for the first time; its first resulting run
(`https://github.com/HookCoding/FrequentistFramework/actions/runs/33629659100`)
passed.

### Gap 3 — `0da38fd`: "Potential fix for pull request finding"

Not a commit made by this session — authored and committed directly by
the user (Harry Hook) via GitHub's web UI, accepting a Copilot Autofix
suggestion on PR #6. Discovered when this session found the branch had
diverged from `origin/tier-3-completion` shortly after the push that
enabled hosted CI, and rebased Gap 2's follow-on commit onto it. Changes
`tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`: merges two adjacent
Python string literals in `APPROVED_SCIENTIFIC_PYTHON_EXECUTABLES` (the
LCG_102a CentOS9/Ubuntu Python executable path strings) into one literal
each — a Copilot-flagged readability finding about relying on implicit
string-literal concatenation. Zero behavioral change (the concatenated
and single-literal forms produce identical string values); confirmed by
this session's full quality gate passing unchanged immediately after the
rebase.

### Verification performed

- `git log --oneline 5cb6a32..HEAD` (13 commits) cross-referenced against
  `grep -n "^## 2026-09-02" doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` (10 entries before this
  one) — confirmed exactly these three gaps and no others.
- Commit timestamps checked directly (`git log --reverse --format="%h %ad
  %s" --date=iso-strict`) to confirm claims in this entry against the
  actual record rather than memory: `0da38fd` (13:52:52+01:00, i.e.
  14:52:52 in this session's own +02:00 commits) postdates `e3379fc`
  (14:19:23+02:00), confirming it was authored on GitHub after the push
  that created the branch there, and predates `351b7d7` (14:59:04+02:00),
  confirming the rebase placed it correctly. This also caught a drafting
  error before commit: an earlier draft of this entry cited "Chunk 1.B
  supplementary verification" (`abfde43`, committed 14:09:51+02:00 —
  before `0da38fd` existed) as having verified Gap 3's change, which is
  impossible by timestamp alone. The commit that actually verified it is
  "Housekeeping — remove duplicate `subprocess` import," whose real
  J100/J50 integration-gate run (164.10s) ran after the rebase and
  exercises `APPROVED_SCIENTIFIC_PYTHON_EXECUTABLES` (the constant
  `0da38fd` edited) directly, since that test validates the runtime
  Python executable against it during the actual rerun.
- No code, test, or gate changes in this entry — documentation only,
  backfilling the record for commits already made, pushed, and verified
  by their own contemporaneous gate runs (Gap 1: no code to verify; Gap 2:
  verified by the hosted CI run cited above; Gap 3: verified as described
  immediately above).
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Current status

All 13 commits currently on `tier-3-completion` (branch point through
`16f61fc`) now have a corresponding activity-log entry. Chunks 2 through
12 remain open.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 2.A: characterization tests for `write_analysis_results`

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `write_analysis_results()` in
`python/run_anaFit.py` before extracting it into `run_manifest.py`, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 2.

### Pre-change state

`write_analysis_results()` already had three direct tests
(`test_write_analysis_results_writes_success_manifest`,
`test_write_analysis_results_records_masked_fit`,
`test_write_analysis_results_atomically_replaces_existing_manifest`),
covering the success payload, the masked-fit payload, and atomic
replacement of a pre-existing manifest. All three pass native `bool`/
`float` values for `masked`/`p_chi2`, so none of them exercises the
function body's explicit `bool(masked)` and `float(p_chi2)` coercion
calls — a real gap, since a value that is merely truthy (not already a
`bool`) or an int (not already a `float`) was never used to prove the
coercion is what actually produces the JSON-native type, as opposed to
the value simply already being the right type.

### Target function — inputs and outputs (as it exists today)

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `write_analysis_results(folder, p_chi2, masked, provenance)` | `folder: str`, `p_chi2: float`, `masked: bool`, `provenance: dict` | `str` (path to the written manifest) | atomically writes `<folder>/analysis_results.json` (schema v2) via a temp file + `os.replace`; deletes no pre-existing state itself (the atomic replace handles that) |

### Tests added

- `test_write_analysis_results_coerces_masked_and_p_chi2_to_json_native_types`
  — calls the real `write_analysis_results()` with `p_chi2=1` (an `int`)
  and `masked=1` (a truthy `int`, not a `bool`), then asserts the written-
  and-reread JSON payload has `p_chi2` as a Python `float` (`1.0`, via
  `isinstance`) and `masked` as the Python `bool` `True` (via `is True`
  and `isinstance`) — proving the function's `bool()`/`float()` calls are
  load-bearing, not redundant.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py`
was empty throughout this change — only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` was
touched (one new test, 29 lines).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v -k write_analysis_results`
  → 4 passed (the 3 existing tests plus the new coercion test), run
  against the unmodified `python/run_anaFit.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v` → 50 passed (full-file
  regression check).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 129 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (10 files unchanged).
- `git diff --stat` → only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` touched.
- `git diff --check` → passed (no whitespace errors).

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Chunk 2, Step A.
2. `git diff --stat` shows only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` — zero
   production files touched.
3. The new test asserts real output values and their concrete Python
   types (`isinstance` checks), not merely "does not raise."
4. Tests were run against the unmodified target file before any
   production change; results reported in full above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 2.B (extraction of `run_manifest.py`) and Chunks 3 through 12 are
open.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 2.B: extract `run_manifest.py`

### Objective

Move `write_analysis_results()`, characterized in Chunk 2.A (commit
`639b94d`), out of `python/run_anaFit.py` into a new
`python/run_manifest.py`, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 2.

### What changed

- `python/run_manifest.py` created, containing `write_analysis_results()`
  moved verbatim from `python/run_anaFit.py` (identical body; only the
  `json`/`os` imports it actually needs were added at module top level).
- `python/run_anaFit.py`: the function definition removed; replaced with
  `from run_manifest import write_analysis_results` (flat sibling-import
  style, added directly below the existing
  `from run_execution import execute, execute_required` line). The single
  call site (inside `run_anaFit()`, assembling the success manifest) is
  unchanged — only the definition moved, not the call site.
- `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`: the `_example_analysis_provenance()` helper
  and all four `write_analysis_results` tests (the three original plus
  Chunk 2.A's new coercion test) removed.
- `tests/test_run_manifest.py` created: the four relocated tests plus
  their `_example_analysis_provenance()` helper, using the plain
  `from python import run_manifest` style (no `ROOT`/sibling stubbing
  needed — this module touches neither) and calling
  `run_manifest.write_analysis_results(...)` directly instead of through
  the `_load_run_anafit_module`/`monkeypatch` machinery, which these tests
  no longer need at all.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `python/run_manifest.py` to
  `python_targets` and `tests/test_run_manifest.py` to `test_targets`.

### Test Relocation Rule: no exception needed this time

Unlike Chunk 1.B (where `execute_required`'s internal call to `execute`
broke the old `monkeypatch.setattr(module, "execute", ...)` target once
the two functions were split across module namespaces),
`write_analysis_results` does not call, or get called by, any other
relocated function — it is called directly by `run_anaFit()`, which stays
in `python/run_anaFit.py`. The two coordinator-level tests
(`test_run_anafit_writes_provenance_for_successful_unmasked_fit`,
`test_run_anafit_quicklimit_failure_prevents_success_manifest`) already
patch `write_analysis_results` via
`monkeypatch.setattr(module, "write_analysis_results", fake)`, where
`module` is the loaded `run_anaFit` object — since `run_anaFit()` still
resolves that name from its own module's globals (now bound there via the
new `from run_manifest import write_analysis_results` line), this
continues to intercept correctly with no change. Confirmed by running
both tests unchanged after the move: both pass. The four relocated tests'
own diff genuinely is import-statement-and-call-site-only, exactly as the
Test Relocation Rule's baseline describes.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`write_analysis_results()`'s body, including the `bool(masked)`/
`float(p_chi2)` coercion Chunk 2.A's new test specifically exercises, is
byte-for-byte identical to before the move. The one call site in
`run_anaFit()` is untouched.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_manifest.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 4 + 46 = 50 passed (same total as before the move: the four
  `write_analysis_results` tests moved out of `test_run_anaFit.py`, into
  `test_run_manifest.py`, net count unchanged).
- `grep -n "^def write_analysis_results" python/run_anaFit.py` → no
  output (definition fully removed).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 129 passed, 2
  deselected; Ruff passed; Black passed (no reformatting needed); exit
  code 0.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- No integration-gate rerun performed for this chunk — Chunk 2 is not one
  of the chunks Section 7 marks mandatory (4, 5, 8, and always before 12);
  `write_analysis_results` touches no branch condition or template logic,
  only relocates one already-isolated pure function.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 2, Step B (this entry).
2. Step A is committed (`639b94d`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are import-statement-and-call-site-only, as
   confirmed above — no monkeypatch-target exception was needed this
   time.
5. The one relocated function is covered by its four relocated tests; no
   new functions were introduced this chunk.
6. Confirmed by grep: `run_anaFit.py` actually imports and never
   redefines `write_analysis_results`.
7. Only this chunk's five changed/new files were staged.
8. All required Section 7 gates ran and passed, output captured above.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunks 3 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 3 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open. Chunk 2
(both Step A and Step B) is complete and verified.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 3.A: characterization tests for the provenance pipeline

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of all seven functions in the
repository-discovery -> path-resolution -> hashing -> Git-revision ->
runtime-collection -> payload-assembly pipeline in `python/run_anaFit.py`
before extracting them into `run_provenance.py`, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 3.

### Pre-change state

All seven target functions already had direct tests (18 test functions,
19 cases counting the `warns_for_tracked_modifications` parametrization):
`get_repository_root` (2), `resolve_analysis_path` (3),
`calculate_file_sha256` (2), `build_file_provenance` (3),
`get_git_revision` (4 cases), `collect_scientific_runtime` (2),
`build_analysis_provenance` (2). All 19 pass unmodified.

Reviewing each function's contract against its tests found one real gap,
duplicated across two functions: both `resolve_analysis_path(path,
repository_root=None)` and `build_file_provenance(path,
repository_root=None)` have a documented `repository_root=None` fallback
branch (`if repository_root is None: repository_root =
get_repository_root()`) that no existing test exercises — every existing
test, and every real call site in `build_analysis_provenance` (confirmed
by `grep -n "resolve_analysis_path(\|build_file_provenance("
python/run_anaFit.py`), always passes `repository_root` explicitly. This
fallback is not currently reached in production, but it is part of each
function's documented signature, and both functions become independently
importable from `python/run_provenance.py` after this chunk, at which
point any future direct caller could reasonably omit it.

### Target functions — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_repository_root()` | none | `Path` | raises `RuntimeError` if no `.git` found |
| `resolve_analysis_path(path, repository_root=None)` | `path: str`, optional `repository_root` | `Path` | raises `FileNotFoundError` if missing |
| `calculate_file_sha256(path)` | `path` | `str` (hex digest) | reads the file in chunks |
| `build_file_provenance(path, repository_root=None)` | as above | `dict {"path", "sha256"}` | — |
| `get_git_revision(repository_path)` | `repository_path` | `(str, bool)` (40-hex SHA, dirty flag) | runs `git rev-parse HEAD` + `git status --porcelain`; warns (does not fail) on a dirty tree |
| `collect_scientific_runtime()` | none | `dict {"python_version","python_executable","root_version"}` | requires `ROOT` importable |
| `build_analysis_provenance(...)` | 12 named arguments | full provenance `dict` | calls all of the above |

### Tests added

- `test_resolve_analysis_path_uses_get_repository_root_when_omitted` —
  patches `get_repository_root` to return a controlled `tmp_path`, calls
  `resolve_analysis_path("Input/data.root")` with `repository_root`
  omitted, asserts the file is resolved relative to the patched root —
  proving the fallback branch actually calls and uses
  `get_repository_root()`.
- `test_build_file_provenance_uses_get_repository_root_when_omitted` —
  same proof for `build_file_provenance`.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py`
was empty throughout this change — only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` was
touched (two new tests, 43 lines).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v -k "sha256 or
  git_revision or scientific_runtime or repository_root or
  resolve_analysis_path or build_file_provenance or
  build_analysis_provenance"` → 21 passed (19 pre-existing cases plus the
  2 new gap tests), run against the unmodified `python/run_anaFit.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v` → 48 passed (full-file
  regression check).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 131 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (12 files unchanged).
- `git diff --stat` → only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` touched.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Chunk 3, Step A.
2. `git diff --stat` shows only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` — zero
   production files touched.
3. Both new tests assert a real resolved path / provenance dict produced
   from a controlled fixture, not merely "does not raise."
4. Tests were run against the unmodified target file before any
   production change; results reported in full above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 3.B (extraction of `run_provenance.py`) and Chunks 4 through 12 are
open.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 3.B: extract `run_provenance.py`

### Objective

Move all seven functions of the provenance pipeline, characterized in
Chunk 3.A (commit `640e6f7`), out of `python/run_anaFit.py` into a new
`python/run_provenance.py`, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 3.
This is the largest extraction by line count so far (227 lines removed
from the coordinator).

### What changed

- `python/run_provenance.py` created, containing `get_repository_root`,
  `resolve_analysis_path`, `calculate_file_sha256`, `build_file_provenance`,
  `get_git_revision`, `collect_scientific_runtime`, and
  `build_analysis_provenance`, moved verbatim, **with the one narrow
  exception the plan explicitly sanctions**: `get_repository_root()` now
  computes its base path via `repo_utils.find_repo_root()` (flat import:
  `from repo_utils import find_repo_root`) instead of its own independent
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]`, then layers the same `.git`
  existence check and `RuntimeError` on top, unchanged. Both expressions
  were already identical in value (both files live directly under
  `python/`), so this removes a real duplication with no behavior change
  to the function's signature, return value, or exception. Formatted with
  `python -m black python/run_provenance.py` once added to the Tier 2
  target list (one whitespace-only change: two adjacent string literals
  in `get_repository_root`'s error message joined onto one physical line
  — no logic change, same message text).
- `collect_scientific_runtime()`'s `import ROOT` moved from
  `run_anaFit.py`'s module top level to inside the function body itself
  (Section 4.2's import-placement table) — it is the only one of the
  seven functions that touches ROOT at all, so every other function in
  the new module is now plainly importable with zero stubbing.
- `python/run_anaFit.py`: all seven function definitions removed;
  replaced with `from run_provenance import build_analysis_provenance`
  (flat sibling-import style). The one call site inside `run_anaFit()`
  is unchanged. File size: 847 -> 622 lines (225 lines removed net: 226
  deleted for the seven function bodies and their spacing, plus 1 added
  for the new import line).
- `tests/test_run_provenance.py` created: the 18 relocated test
  functions (19 cases) plus Chunk 3.A's 2 new gap tests (20 functions, 21
  cases total), using the plain `from python import run_provenance` style.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `python/run_provenance.py` to
  `python_targets` and `tests/test_run_provenance.py` to `test_targets`.

### A real infrastructure gap the acceptance check caught

Running the acceptance check immediately after writing
`tests/test_run_provenance.py` failed at collection:
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'repo_utils'`, raised from
`run_provenance.py`'s own `from repo_utils import find_repo_root` line.
Cause: `from python import run_provenance` (the plain, no-stubbing import
style established in Chunks 1-2) only works because `pyproject.toml`'s
`pythonpath = ["."]` puts the **repository root** on `sys.path`, making
`python` importable as a namespace package — it never puts `python/`
itself on `sys.path`. Chunks 1 and 2's new modules (`run_execution.py`,
`run_manifest.py`) never hit this because neither imports another sibling
module; `run_provenance.py` is the first new module to import a sibling
(`repo_utils`) using the same flat style production requires. In
production this is not a problem — `python/` is `sys.path[0]` for the
whole process once `run_anaFit.py` is invoked directly, so `run_provenance.py`'s
own flat import resolves the same way `run_anaFit.py`'s already-flat
sibling imports do. The gap is purely in how the *test* loads the module.

Fix: added `"python"` to `pyproject.toml`'s `pythonpath` list
(`pythonpath = [".", "python"]`), so `python/` is on `sys.path` for every
test in the suite, alongside the repository root. This is a one-line,
general, forward-looking fix rather than a per-file `sys.path` hack in
`tests/test_run_provenance.py` alone — the plan's own Chunk 6 already
anticipates `run_fit.py` needing flat imports from `run_execution.py`
(the same pattern), so this would have recurred. Re-ran the full
acceptance check after the fix: collection succeeded, all tests passed.

### Two more Test Relocation Rule exceptions, both anticipated in Chunk 3.A

1. `test_get_repository_root_rejects_missing_git_directory` — the
   original faked a missing-`.git` directory by patching the loaded
   module's `__file__` attribute, which only worked because
   `get_repository_root()` used to compute `Path(__file__)` against its
   *own* module. Once it delegates to `find_repo_root()` (now living in
   `repo_utils.py`, with its own separate `__file__`), that patch target
   no longer reaches anything. Rewritten to patch
   `run_provenance.find_repo_root` directly (as looked up in
   `run_provenance`'s own namespace) — same `RuntimeError`/message
   asserted, simpler fixture (no longer needs to fabricate a nested
   `python/run_anaFit.py` file, just a directory without `.git`).
2. `test_collect_scientific_runtime_records_python_and_root` and
   `test_collect_scientific_runtime_rejects_missing_root_version` — the
   originals patched `module.ROOT.gROOT`, relying on `run_anaFit.py`'s
   top-level `import ROOT`. With the import deferred inside the function,
   there is no module-level `run_provenance.ROOT` attribute to patch —
   the function does its own local `import ROOT` on every call. Rewritten
   to install a fake module directly via
   `monkeypatch.setitem(sys.modules, "ROOT", fake_root_module)` before
   calling the function, which is exactly what the function's own local
   `import ROOT` statement finds (Python checks `sys.modules` before
   doing any real import work). Same assertions, same expected values.

Neither is a hidden behavior change to the function under test — both are
necessary, transparent consequences of where the code and its ROOT
dependency now live, exactly as already documented for Chunk 1.B's
`execute`/`execute_required` monkeypatch-target change.

### No exception needed for the other four relocated functions' cross-calls

`build_analysis_provenance`'s tests patch `get_repository_root`,
`get_git_revision`, `collect_scientific_runtime`, and
`build_file_provenance` via `monkeypatch.setattr(run_provenance, ...)` —
mechanically the same pattern as before (`module.X` -> `run_provenance.X`),
since all seven functions moved into the *same* new module together and
call each other exactly as they did inside `run_anaFit.py`. Confirmed by
running both `build_analysis_provenance` tests unchanged in logic after
the move: both pass. Likewise, the two coordinator-level tests in
`tests/test_run_anaFit.py` that patch `module.build_analysis_provenance`
continue to work unchanged, for the same reason as Chunk 2.B's
`write_analysis_results`: `run_anaFit()` didn't move, and still resolves
that name from its own module globals (now bound there via the new
`from run_provenance import build_analysis_provenance` line).

### Deliberately deferred: three now-dead imports in `run_anaFit.py`

`hashlib` and `platform` (previously used only by `calculate_file_sha256`
and `collect_scientific_runtime`) and `subprocess` (previously used only
by `get_git_revision`; its one other appearance in the file is a comment,
not code — confirmed by `grep -n "\bsubprocess\." python/run_anaFit.py`)
are now unused in `run_anaFit.py`. Left in place deliberately rather than
removed as part of this chunk: `run_anaFit.py` is not yet registered in
`scripts/quality_check.py` (so ruff's unused-import check does not run
against it today), and Chunk 8 ("Coordinator slimming and
dependency-direction verification") explicitly exists to re-read the
coordinator top-to-bottom, register it with the quality gate, and fix
whatever ruff then finds — bundling this cleanup into Chunk 3.B now would
widen this chunk's diff beyond "move these seven functions" for a
one-chunk-early version of Chunk 8's own stated job. Flagged here so
Chunk 8 does not need to rediscover it.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

Every function's body is byte-for-byte identical to before the move
(aside from the one Black whitespace-only reformat noted above and the
sanctioned `find_repo_root()` substitution, which is value-identical).
Ran the real, authoritative J100/J50 integration gate as supplementary
verification (not strictly mandatory for Chunk 3 per Section 7, but this
chunk changes the actual code path that computes `repository_commit` for
`analysis_results.json`, so extra confidence was warranted, matching the
same judgment call made for Chunk 1.B): both workflows matched the frozen
reference exactly.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_provenance.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 48 passed (21 cases in `test_run_provenance.py` + 27 remaining in
  `test_run_anaFit.py` = 48, matching the pre-move total of 48 exactly).
- `grep -n "^def get_repository_root\|^def resolve_analysis_path\|^def calculate_file_sha256\|^def build_file_provenance\|^def get_git_revision\|^def collect_scientific_runtime\|^def build_analysis_provenance" python/run_anaFit.py`
  → no output (all seven definitions fully removed).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 131 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (14 files unchanged after the one
  reformat above); exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
  → 2 passed, 11 deselected (run because the new module now imports from
  `repo_utils.py`).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed in 181.04s — the real J100/J50 authoritative pipeline run,
  matched against the frozen reference exactly.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 3, Step B (this entry).
2. Step A is committed (`640e6f7`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are import-statement-and-call-site-only for the
   17 functions with no cross-module dependency change; two genuine
   exceptions (`find_repo_root` patch target, `sys.modules["ROOT"]`
   stubbing) documented above as necessary consequences, not hidden
   behavior changes.
5. All seven relocated functions are covered by their relocated tests; no
   new functions were introduced this chunk.
6. Confirmed by grep: `run_anaFit.py` actually imports and never
   redefines any of the seven functions.
7. Only this chunk's six changed/new files were staged (`pyproject.toml`,
   `python/run_anaFit.py`, `python/run_provenance.py`,
   `scripts/quality_check.py`, `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`,
   `tests/test_run_provenance.py`).
8. All required Section 7 gates ran and passed, plus two supplementary
   gates (dependency-facing, authoritative integration), output captured
   above.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunks 4 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 4 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open. Chunk 3
(both Step A and Step B) is complete and verified.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 4.A: characterization tests for `load_bumphunter_results`/`run_bumphunter`

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `load_bumphunter_results()`
and `run_bumphunter()` in `python/run_anaFit.py` before extracting them
into `run_masking.py`, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 4.
`should_mask()` is a new function with no prior behavior to characterize
(per the plan's own explicit carve-out), so it has no Step A tests —
those are written fresh in Step B under guardrail 4.

### Pre-change state

Both target functions already had eight direct tests (ten cases counting
`rejects_invalid_mask_limits`'s three-way parametrization). All ten pass
unmodified. Reviewing `load_bumphunter_results()`'s four validation
branches against its four existing tests found two branches with no
coverage at all: the `if not isinstance(results, dict)` check (every
fixture is already a dict) and the `BlindRange` non-empty-string check
(every fixture already uses `"500,600"` or `"stale"`).

### A discrepancy between the plan's rationale and the actual code, found while re-reading `run_anaFit()`

The plan's Chunk 4 rationale states "both call sites already use the
exact same `>` comparison," citing `if pval_global > maskthreshold` and
`if pval_masked > maskthreshold`. Re-reading the coordinator directly
found a **third** occurrence of the identical `pval_global > maskthreshold`
sub-expression, reused inside a compound condition at what is currently
line 530: `if dolimit and dosignal and pval_global > maskthreshold:`
(gates whether `quickLimit` runs). This is exactly the kind of
duplication-that-drifts-unnoticed the chunk exists to eliminate, and
leaving it as a bare `>` comparison while the other two sites call
`should_mask()` would defeat the point. Step B will replace all three
occurrences, not the two the plan's rationale text named -
`test_run_anafit_quicklimit_failure_prevents_success_manifest` already
exercises this exact branch (`dosignal=True, dolimit=True, pval_global=0.25`
mocked, `maskthreshold=0.01`), so it doubles as the regression check for
this third call site's rewrite with no new test needed.

### A second Test Relocation Rule exception anticipated for Step B

`run_bumphunter()` calls `execute_required(...)`, which lives in
`run_execution.py`, a different module from where `run_bumphunter` is
moving (`run_masking.py`). Its four tests currently patch
`module.execute_required` (`module` = the loaded `run_anaFit` object) -
this only works today because both functions are defined in the same
module. Once `run_bumphunter` moves, `execute_required` will be looked up
in `run_masking`'s own namespace (via its own `from run_execution import
execute_required`), so the relocated tests will need to patch
`run_masking.execute_required` directly - the same necessary-consequence
pattern already documented for Chunk 1.B's `execute`/`execute_required`
split and Chunk 3.B's `find_repo_root`/`ROOT` cases.

### Target functions — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `load_bumphunter_results(results_file)` | `results_file: str` | `dict {"BlindRange","MaskMin","MaskMax"}` | raises `ValueError` on malformed input |
| `run_bumphunter(postfitfile, folder)` | `postfitfile: str`, `folder: str` | same shape as above | deletes stale `BHresults.json`; runs the BumpHunter subprocess; raises `RuntimeError` on failure |

### Tests added

- `test_load_bumphunter_results_rejects_non_dict_payload` — a JSON array
  instead of an object, asserts `"must be a JSON object"`.
- `test_load_bumphunter_results_rejects_invalid_blind_range` (parametrized
  `["", "   "]`) — asserts `"BlindRange must be a non-empty string"`.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py`
was empty throughout this change — only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` was
touched (two new tests, 38 lines).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v -k "load_bumphunter_results
  or run_bumphunter"` → 13 passed (10 pre-existing cases plus the 3 new
  gap-test cases), run against the unmodified `python/run_anaFit.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v` → 30 passed (full-file
  regression check).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 134 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (14 files unchanged).
- `git diff --stat` → only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` touched.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Chunk 4, Step A.
2. `git diff --stat` shows only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` — zero
   production files touched.
3. Both new tests assert the real, specific `ValueError` message for
   their branch, not merely "does not raise."
4. Tests were run against the unmodified target file before any
   production change; results reported in full above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 4.B (extraction of `run_masking.py`) and Chunks 5 through 12 are
open.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 4.B: extract `run_masking.py`

### Objective

Move `load_bumphunter_results()` and `run_bumphunter()`, characterized in
Chunk 4.A (commit `4930636`), out of `python/run_anaFit.py` into a new
`python/run_masking.py`, add the new `should_mask(p_value, threshold)`
predicate, and replace all three coordinator-level `> maskthreshold`
comparisons with calls to it, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 4.

### What changed

- `python/run_masking.py` created, containing `load_bumphunter_results()`
  and `run_bumphunter()` moved verbatim, plus the new
  `should_mask(p_value, threshold)`, returning `p_value <= threshold` -
  `True` exactly when the coordinator's original `if pval_global >
  maskthreshold` branch would **not** be taken, matching its existing `>`
  convention precisely.
- `python/run_anaFit.py`: both function definitions removed; replaced
  with `from run_masking import run_bumphunter, should_mask` (flat
  sibling-import style; `load_bumphunter_results` is not imported here -
  it is called only internally by `run_bumphunter`, confirmed by
  `grep -n "load_bumphunter_results(\|run_bumphunter(" python/run_anaFit.py`
  before the move). All **three** `> maskthreshold` call sites rewritten,
  per Chunk 4.A's finding:
  - `if pval_global > maskthreshold` -> `if not should_mask(pval_global, maskthreshold)`
  - `if pval_masked > maskthreshold` -> `if not should_mask(pval_masked, maskthreshold)`
  - `if dolimit and dosignal and pval_global > maskthreshold` -> `if dolimit and dosignal and not should_mask(pval_global, maskthreshold)`
  Each preserves the exact original control flow (`p > t` is logically
  `not (p <= t)`, i.e. `not should_mask(p, t)`).
- `tests/test_run_masking.py` created: the ten relocated test functions
  (13 cases) plus the new `test_should_mask_matches_coordinator_convention_at_exact_threshold`
  (parametrized: exact threshold, clearly below, clearly above), using
  the plain `from python import run_masking` style.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `python/run_masking.py` to
  `python_targets` and `tests/test_run_masking.py` to `test_targets`.

### The anticipated Test Relocation Rule exception, confirmed

`run_bumphunter`'s four tests patch `execute_required` - as flagged in
Chunk 4.A, this now targets `run_masking.execute_required` (the name
bound in `run_masking`'s own namespace via its own `from run_execution
import execute_required`), not the old `module.execute_required`. Same
pattern as Chunk 1.B and Chunk 3.B: a necessary consequence of
`execute_required` living in a different module from where it is called,
not a hidden behavior change. `run_bumphunter`'s own intra-module call to
`load_bumphunter_results` needed no such change - both moved into
`run_masking.py` together.

### A second dead-import discovery, fixed immediately this time (unlike Chunk 3.B's deferral)

`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` failed ruff (`F401 'json'
imported but unused`) on `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`: relocating all six
`load_bumphunter_results` tests removed every remaining use of `json.` in
that file. Unlike Chunk 3.B's `hashlib`/`platform`/`subprocess` dead
imports in `python/run_anaFit.py` (deliberately deferred to Chunk 8,
because that file is not yet registered with the quality gate at all),
`tests/test_run_anaFit.py` **is already** in `test_targets` - ruff runs
against it on every gate today, so this was not a "some later chunk will
clean it up" situation but a real, immediate gate failure caused directly
by this chunk's own test relocation. Fixed by removing the now-unused
`import json` line. Re-ran the full gate afterward: clean.

### Confirm: scientific behavior preserved, including the newly-discovered third call site

Both `load_bumphunter_results()` and `run_bumphunter()`'s bodies are
byte-for-byte identical to before the move. The three rewritten
comparisons are logically equivalent to the originals (confirmed by
inspection, not just by test result). Ran the full targeted acceptance
check plus the **mandatory** integration gate (per Section 7, this chunk
changes real branch conditions):
`test_run_anafit_quicklimit_failure_prevents_success_manifest`
(`dosignal=True, dolimit=True, pval_global=0.25 mocked, maskthreshold=0.01`)
passed unchanged, directly exercising the third call site's rewrite. The
real, authoritative J100/J50 pipeline also passed, matching the frozen
reference exactly - both canonical workflows still take the unmasked
accept path through all three rewritten conditions.

### Verification performed

- `grep -n "maskthreshold" python/run_anaFit.py` → confirms all three
  comparisons now call `should_mask()`; the other five matches are the
  argparse definition, kwarg passthroughs, and a print statement,
  unaffected.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_masking.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 33 passed (16 cases in `test_run_masking.py` + 17 remaining in
  `test_run_anaFit.py` = 33, matching the pre-move total of 30 plus the 3
  new `should_mask` cases exactly).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 137 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean (after the `json` import fix); black clean (16
  files unchanged); exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed in 150.66s - the real J100/J50 authoritative pipeline run,
  **mandatory** for this chunk per Section 7, matched against the frozen
  reference exactly.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 4, Step B (this entry).
2. Step A is committed (`4930636`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched. The three rewritten branch
   conditions are logically equivalent to the originals, verified by both
   unit and integration tests.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are import-statement-and-call-site-only except
   the one documented, anticipated `execute_required` patch-target
   change.
5. `should_mask()` (the one new function) is covered by three cases
   (exact threshold, clearly below, clearly above), per the plan's
   explicit requirement.
6. Confirmed by grep: `run_anaFit.py` actually imports and never
   redefines `run_bumphunter`/`should_mask`; all three comparisons now
   call `should_mask()`.
7. Only this chunk's five changed/new files were staged.
8. All required Section 7 gates ran and passed, including the mandatory
   integration gate, output captured above.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunks 5 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 5 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open. Chunk 4
(both Step A and Step B) is complete and verified.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 5.A: first-ever characterization tests for the templating/prefit block

### Objective

Write the **first direct tests ever** for `replaceinfile()` and the
~150-line inline templating/prefit block inside `run_anaFit()`, before
extracting them into `python/run_templates.py`, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 5. Per the plan's own framing, this
is a genuine characterization step, not a formality: this logic has never
been pinned down at the unit level before, only indirectly through the
full J100/J50 integration gate.

### Finalizing `prepare_run_templates(...)`'s exact signature (the plan's own draft table needed correction)

The plan's Chunk 5 module table listed a draft input list explicitly
flagged "finalize the exact set while reading the current block." Doing
that reading directly against the source (not the draft) found:

- `nbkg` and `nsig` are **missing from the plan's draft input list** but
  are genuinely required: `nbkg` is read and conditionally reassigned
  (by the `doprefit` branch) before being substituted into the category
  file; `nsig` is read as a substitution value. Both must be parameters.
- `nbkg`'s prefit-reassignment does **not** need to be returned to the
  coordinator: `grep -n "\bnbkg\b" python/run_anaFit.py` confirms it is
  never read again after the block's own final `replaceinfile` call.
- `signame` never changes inside the block - it is a pass-through
  substitution value, not something the block "derives." No output
  needed for it, contrary to the draft table's "any poi/signame derived
  values" phrasing.
- `poi` is decided by a **separate**, unrelated piece of coordinator
  logic (`if dosignal: poi = ... else: poi = None`) immediately after the
  block, which touches no template file and calls neither
  `replaceinfile` nor `PreFitter`. It is out of this chunk's scope
  (Chunk 6's concern, since it only feeds `build_fit_extract`), not part
  of `prepare_run_templates`.
- `tmptopfile`, `tmpcategoryfile`, `xml_categoryfile`, and `xml_wsfile`
  **are** read again after the block (in the masking branch, to stage the
  masked-refit XML copies) - confirmed by
  `grep -n "tmpcategoryfile\|xml_categoryfile\|xml_wsfile" python/run_anaFit.py`.
  These four must be the function's return value.
- `covariancedict` is a `run_anaFit()` parameter but is **entirely
  unused** in live code today - every reference to it is inside a
  commented-out block. It will not be threaded into
  `prepare_run_templates` in Step B; there is no live behavior depending
  on it.

Final signature for Step B:
`prepare_run_templates(folder, topfile, categoryfile, backgroundfile,
signalfile, signame, wsfile, sigmean, sigwidth, datafile, datahist,
rangelow, rangehigh, nbkg, nsig, doprefit, systdict)` returning
`(tmptopfile, tmpcategoryfile, xml_categoryfile, xml_wsfile)`.

### A real, previously-undocumented quirk found while hand-verifying the prefit test

Writing `test_run_anafit_prefit_seeds_background_file_from_fitted_parameters`
first assumed the PAR-substitution loop replaces each whole `[PARn,lo,hi]`
range annotation with the fitted value. Running the test against the
unmodified file disproved this: the loop is a plain
`replaceinfile(tmpbackgroundfile, [("PAR%d" % (i+1), str(initPars[i]))])`
per parameter - a naive substring/regex swap of the literal text `PARn`,
not a replacement of the surrounding annotation. The `[...,lo,hi]`
brackets survive in the output file with only the `PARn` token inside
them replaced (e.g. `[PAR1,-5,5]` becomes `[11.0,-5,5]`, not `11.0`) -
and because `replaceinfile` operates over the whole file text, this
happens even inside HTML/XML comments (`<!-- ... [PAR1,-99,99] ... -->`
becomes `<!-- ... [11.0,-99,99] ... -->`). This is real, current,
unrelated-to-doprefit-testing-before-now behavior; the test now pins it
down exactly as observed rather than as originally assumed. Step B must
preserve it exactly - it is exactly the kind of thing an implementer
"fixes" by accident while moving code.

### Target functions — inputs and outputs

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `replaceinfile(f, old_new_list)` | `f: str`, `old_new_list: list[tuple[str,str]]` | `None` | rewrites `f` in place, applying each `re.sub` in order (substitutions chain against the already-modified text) |
| `prepare_run_templates(...)` (new in Step B) | see finalized signature above | `(tmptopfile, tmpcategoryfile, xml_categoryfile, xml_wsfile)` | copies/edits XML template files on disk; runs `PreFitter` when `doprefit` is set |

### Tests added (all new — this block had zero direct tests before)

- `test_replaceinfile_applies_ordered_regex_substitutions` — chains
  `PLACEHOLDER_A -> PLACEHOLDER_B -> final_value` to prove substitutions
  apply in order against the already-modified text, not independently
  against the original.
- `test_run_anafit_stages_templates_for_a_representative_case` —
  `doprefit=False`, `signalfile=None`; asserts the exact generated
  `tmptopfile`/`tmpcategoryfile` content, including that the
  `SIGNALFILE` placeholder is substituted with a computed path even
  though no signal file was provided (confirmed real: `tmpsignalfile`/
  `xml_signalfile` are computed unconditionally in production).
- `test_run_anafit_prefit_seeds_background_file_from_fitted_parameters` —
  `doprefit=True`, a background file name containing "six" (nPars=6), a
  background file with two real `[PARn,lo,hi]` `<ModelItem>` lines (one
  commented out, correctly excluded from range parsing) and a
  `FakePreFitter` test double; asserts the exact `parRangeLow`/
  `parRangeHigh` passed to `PreFitter`, the exact seeded background-file
  content (including the quirk above), and the exact `NBKG` string
  format derived from the fitted value.
- `test_run_anafit_prefit_npars_detection_matching_both_three_and_four_resolves_to_four` —
  the plan's required regression test: a background file path containing
  both `"three"` and `"four"`; asserts `PreFitter` is constructed with
  `nPars=4`, pinning down the standalone-`if`-then-separate-`elif`-chain
  quirk exactly as it exists today.
- `test_run_anafit_stages_signal_template_with_systematic_placeholders` —
  a populated `systdict`; asserts the exact seeded signal-file content,
  including both named systematic sources substituted and an unlisted
  `[MAG_SCALE_UNLISTED]` placeholder caught by the catch-all pattern and
  replaced with `[0]`.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py`
was empty throughout this change — only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` was
touched (five new tests, 402 lines).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v -k "replaceinfile or
  stages_templates or prefit_seeds or npars_detection or
  systematic_placeholders"` → 5 passed, run against the unmodified
  `python/run_anaFit.py`. One assertion (the PAR-substitution content)
  was corrected after the first run disproved the initial hand-derived
  expectation, per the quirk documented above — a real characterization
  correction, not a retrofit to make a test pass.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v` → 22 passed (full-file
  regression check).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 142 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean after one whitespace/quote-style
  reformat (`python -m black tests/test_run_anaFit.py`, no logic change).
- `git diff --stat` → only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` touched.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Chunk 5, Step A.
2. `git diff --stat` shows only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` — zero
   production files touched.
3. Every new test asserts exact generated file content or exact
   `PreFitter` constructor arguments, not merely "does not raise."
4. Tests were run against the unmodified target file before any
   production change; results (including the corrected assertion)
   reported in full above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made, with the extra weight the
   plan calls for given these are first-ever tests, not a relocation —
   recorded per Step B's own activity-log entry once given.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 5.B (extraction and internal decomposition of `run_templates.py`)
and Chunks 6 through 12 are open.

## 2026-09-02: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 5.B: extract and decompose `run_templates.py`

### Objective

Move `replaceinfile()` and the ~150-line inline templating/prefit block,
characterized in Chunk 5.A (commit `8d614ee`), out of `run_anaFit()` into
a new `python/run_templates.py`, decomposed into the two private helpers
the plan names plus one public entry point (not moved intact as one
function), per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 5. This is the
biggest and, per the plan's own framing, riskiest extraction so far
(199 lines net removed from the coordinator).

### What changed

- `python/run_templates.py` created with three functions:
  - `replaceinfile(f, old_new_list)`, moved verbatim.
  - `_seed_prefit_parameters(datafile, datahist, rangelow, rangehigh,
    backgroundfile, tmpbackgroundfile, nbkg)` (private) — the `doprefit`
    sub-block: the `nPars` if/then-separate-elif-chain detection (copied
    exactly, per Chunk 5.A's regression test), the `[PARn,lo,hi]`
    range-parsing regex, the `PreFitter` call, and the background-file
    PAR substitution loop. Returns the updated `nbkg`. `from PreFit
    import PreFitter` is deferred inside this function (Section 4.2's
    import-placement rule) — it is the only place in the module that
    touches a ROOT-facing tool.
  - `_stage_xml_templates(...)` (private) — everything else: the `.dtd`
    symlink, path computation, file copies, top/category-file
    substitution, calling `_seed_prefit_parameters` when
    `backgroundfile and doprefit`, the final category-file substitution,
    and the signal-file substitution (including the `systdict`-driven
    placeholders and the catch-all). Returns `(tmptopfile,
    tmpcategoryfile, xml_categoryfile, xml_wsfile)` — the finalized
    signature from Chunk 5.A's analysis.
  - `prepare_run_templates(...)` (public) — a thin entry point that calls
    `_stage_xml_templates(...)` and returns its result. This is the one
    public function `run_anaFit()` now calls.
  - All original comments preserved verbatim, including the dead,
    commented-out alternative implementations (the two alternate `.dtd`
    symlink commands, the commented `replaceinfile(tmpsignalfile,
    [SIGMEAN, SIGWIDTH])` block, and the entire commented-out
    `covariancedict` block) - dropping inert comments was judged an
    unnecessary editorial decision for a chunk whose job is to move code,
    not curate it.
- `python/run_anaFit.py`: `replaceinfile()`'s definition and the inline
  block both removed; replaced with `from run_templates import
  prepare_run_templates, replaceinfile` (flat sibling-import style) and a
  single call to `prepare_run_templates(...)`, unpacking its four return
  values. `replaceinfile` itself is still imported (not just
  `prepare_run_templates`) because `run_anaFit()`'s masking branch calls
  it directly for the masked-refit XML copies (`tmptopfilemasked`/
  `tmpcategoryfilemasked`) - confirmed by `grep -n "replaceinfile("
  python/run_anaFit.py` before editing, which is why this wasn't
  mentioned in Chunk 5.A's signature analysis (that only covered the
  block being moved, not this separate downstream call site).
- `tests/test_run_templates.py` created with the 5 tests from Chunk 5.A,
  **rewritten to call `run_templates.prepare_run_templates(...)` and
  `run_templates.replaceinfile(...)` directly** rather than through
  `run_anaFit()` end-to-end (see below) - all assertions and expected
  values are unchanged from Chunk 5.A, only what gets called changed.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `python/run_templates.py` to
  `python_targets` and `tests/test_run_templates.py` to `test_targets`.

### Necessary test-relocation adaptation: direct calls, not `run_anaFit()` end-to-end

Chunk 5.A's tests called `module.run_anaFit(...)` end-to-end (mocking
away `build_fit_extract`/`build_analysis_provenance`/
`write_analysis_results`) because no standalone function existed yet to
call directly - that was the whole point of Chunk 5.A being a genuine
first-ever characterization, not a relocation. Now that
`prepare_run_templates()` exists as a real, directly-callable function,
the plan's own text says the relocated tests should scope ROOT/PreFitter
stubbing "only to the `_seed_prefit_parameters` calls (the rest of the
module needs none)" - this is only true if the tests call into
`run_templates.py` directly, not through `run_anaFit.py` (which still
does a top-level `import ROOT` regardless of what `run_templates.py`
itself needs). Rewriting the 4 end-to-end tests as direct
`prepare_run_templates(...)` calls confirmed this: none of the mocking
of `build_fit_extract`/`build_analysis_provenance`/`write_analysis_results`
is needed anymore, and only the two `doprefit=True` tests need any
stubbing at all - not `sys.modules["ROOT"]`, but
`sys.modules["PreFit"]` (a fake module with a fake `PreFitter` class),
since `_seed_prefit_parameters`'s `from PreFit import PreFitter` is
function-local and resolves via `sys.modules` on every call, exactly
like Chunk 3.B's `collect_scientific_runtime`/`ROOT` case. All five
tests' assertions and expected values are byte-for-byte the same as
Chunk 5.A wrote them - only the call mechanism changed, confirmed by
running them against the moved code and getting identical results
(including the quirky PAR-substitution content).

### A third dead import, deferred like Chunk 3.B's (not fixed like Chunk 4.B's)

`grep -n "\bre\." python/run_anaFit.py` after the move returns nothing:
`re` (part of the combined `import os,sys,re,argparse,subprocess,shutil`
line) is now unused - both of its uses (`replaceinfile`'s `re.sub` and
the prefit block's `re.findall`) moved with the code. Unlike Chunk 4.B's
`tests/test_run_anaFit.py` `json` import (a live gate failure, fixed
immediately because that file is already quality-gated), `re` joins
`hashlib`/`platform`/`subprocess` in `run_anaFit.py`, which is still not
registered in `scripts/quality_check.py` - left in place for Chunk 8's
coordinator-slimming pass, per the same reasoning as Chunk 3.B.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

Every moved line of logic is byte-for-byte identical (aside from the
ruff/black-driven fixes below, all verified whitespace/syntax-only). Ran
the **mandatory** integration gate (per Section 7, explicitly required
for this chunk): the real, authoritative J100/J50 pipeline passed,
matching the frozen reference exactly - the strongest available
confirmation that the decomposition did not change the generated XML in
any way that matters to the fit.

### Ruff/Black fixes required to register the new file (mechanical, zero behavior change)

Registering `run_templates.py` in `python_targets` surfaced pre-existing
issues in the moved code that were never checked while it lived inside
the un-gated `run_anaFit.py`:
- `E722` bare `except:` in `replaceinfile` -> `except Exception:` (does
  not change what the `try` block can raise: `re.sub` never raises
  `SystemExit`/`KeyboardInterrupt`).
- `E713`/`E711` -> `"<!--" not in line` and `systdict is not None`,
  syntactically equivalent rewrites.
- `W605` (9 instances) -> the `[PARn,...]`-parsing and `MAG_*`
  substitution regex patterns changed from plain to raw string literals
  (`r"..."`); the resulting string values are byte-identical either way
  (`\[`, `\d`, `\-` are not valid Python escapes in a plain string, so
  Python already treated them as literal backslash+character - `r"..."`
  just stops the interpreter's `SyntaxWarning`).
- A few `E501` (line too long) wraps, including two multi-line splits of
  dead comment text.
- `python -m black python/run_templates.py`: one further whitespace-only
  reformat.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_templates.py -v` → 5 passed, in
  isolation, confirming zero `ROOT`/`PreFit` stubbing is needed for 3 of
  the 5 tests and only `sys.modules["PreFit"]` (not `ROOT`) for the other
  2.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_templates.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 22 passed (5 + 17, matching the pre-move total of 22 exactly).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 142 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (18 files unchanged); exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed in 123.97s - **mandatory** for this chunk, matched against
  the frozen reference exactly.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 5, Step B (this entry).
2. Step A is committed (`8d614ee`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are not import-line-only - the call target
   changed from `module.run_anaFit(...)` to
   `run_templates.prepare_run_templates(...)`/`replaceinfile(...)`
   directly, documented above as a necessary, anticipated consequence of
   the function now existing standalone; no assertion or expected value
   changed.
5. All three new/moved functions are covered: `replaceinfile` (1 test),
   `prepare_run_templates`/`_stage_xml_templates` (3 tests covering the
   representative, signal-systematics, and nPars-regression cases), and
   `_seed_prefit_parameters` (2 tests, including the nPars regression).
6. Confirmed by grep: `run_anaFit.py` actually imports and never
   redefines `prepare_run_templates`/`replaceinfile`.
7. Only this chunk's five changed/new files were staged.
8. All required Section 7 gates ran and passed, including the mandatory
   integration gate, output captured above.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunks 6 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 6 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open. Chunk 5
(both Step A and Step B) is complete and verified - the plan's riskiest
single extraction is done.

## 2026-09-02: Fix should_mask() to preserve NaN behavior (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### What Copilot found

On Chunk 4.B's `should_mask(p_value, threshold)`, implemented as
`return p_value <= threshold`: this looks equivalent to the coordinator's
original `not (p_value > threshold)` gating for ordinary floats, but is
not equivalent for NaN. Under IEEE 754 comparison rules, both
`nan > threshold` and `nan <= threshold` are `False`. So the original
code (`if pval_global > maskthreshold: <success> else: <masking>`) would
take the masking branch for a NaN p-value (a real possibility from a
degenerate fit), while `not should_mask(nan, threshold)` (`not (nan <=
threshold)` = `not False` = `True`) would take the *success* branch
instead - silently skipping masking/BumpHunter for a NaN fit result.

### Verification performed before fixing

Confirmed directly in Python rather than taking the claim on faith:
`nan > 0.01` is `False` and `nan <= 0.01` is `False` too - so the two
candidate implementations of `should_mask()` genuinely disagree for a
NaN input: the buggy `p_value <= threshold` gives `False` (so `not
should_mask(nan, t)` is `True`, taking the coordinator's success
branch), while the correct `not (p_value > threshold)` gives `True` (so
`not should_mask(nan, t)` is `False`, taking the masking branch) -
matching what the original inline `if pval_global > maskthreshold:`
would have done before Chunk 4 extracted it. Traced through
`run_anaFit()`'s three call sites (`not should_mask(pval_global, ...)`,
`not should_mask(pval_masked, ...)`, `dolimit and dosignal and not
should_mask(pval_global, ...)`) to confirm all three would be affected
identically by a NaN p-value with the buggy implementation.

### Fix

`python/run_masking.py`: `should_mask()` changed from `p_value <=
threshold` to `not (p_value > threshold)` - byte-for-byte the
coordinator's original gating condition, negated, with a comment
explaining why the two forms are not interchangeable. This is not a
convention change (both forms give identical results for every ordinary
float); it only changes behavior for NaN, which is exactly the point.

`tests/test_run_masking.py`:
`test_should_mask_treats_nan_p_value_as_requiring_masking` added -
asserts `should_mask(float("nan"), 0.01) is True`, which fails against
the old `p_value <= threshold` implementation (confirmed by the Python
check above) and passes against the fix.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_masking.py -v -k should_mask` → 4
  passed (3 pre-existing cases plus the new NaN case).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_masking.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 34 passed (33 + 1 new test).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 143 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (18 files unchanged).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed in 117.12s - the real J100/J50 pipeline, rerun as
  supplementary confirmation since this touches the exact masking
  predicate at the heart of the coordinator's branch logic (matching the
  same judgment call made for Chunk 1.B and Chunk 3.B); the canonical
  workflows produce well-behaved, non-NaN p-values, so this confirms the
  non-NaN path is unaffected by the fix, as expected.
- `git diff --check` → passed.

### Scope

Only `python/run_masking.py` and `tests/test_run_masking.py` touched.
Not folded into any later chunk's work - a review finding on already-
pushed Chunk 4 work, fixed immediately as its own commit, per this
project's established practice for Copilot review findings.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 6.A: characterization tests for `build_fit_extract`

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `build_fit_extract()` in
`python/run_anaFit.py` before extracting it into `run_fit.py`, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 6.

### Pre-change state

Two failure-path tests already existed
(`test_build_fit_extract_stops_after_xmlreader_failure`,
`test_build_fit_extract_stops_after_quickfit_failure`), both passing
unmodified. Per the plan's Section 2 baseline, these only cover the two
`execute_required` failure branches — no test exercised the successful
path at all: the `ROOT.TFile`/`FindBin` lookup for `datafirstbin`, the
mask-range branch on the quickFit command, the `PostfitExtractor`/
`FitParameterExtractor` calls, or the p-value-source selection between
`Run3TLA_rebinned` and `Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned`.

### Target function — inputs and outputs (as it exists today)

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build_fit_extract(topfile, datafile, datahist, rangelow, rangehigh, wsfile, fitresultfile, poi=None, maskrange=None)` | as listed | `(pval: float, postfitfile: str, parameterfile: str)` | runs XMLReader + quickFit subprocesses; writes ROOT files; may generate a resolution-binning file; shells out to `plot_edm.py` |

### Tests added

- `test_build_fit_extract_succeeds_for_unmasked_fit` — drives the full
  successful path with `maskrange=None` using controlled test doubles
  (`_FakeTFile`/`_FakeHist` for the `ROOT.TFile`/`FindBin` lookup,
  `_FakePostfitExtractor`, `_FakeFitParameterExtractor`); asserts the
  returned `(pval, postfitfile, parameterfile)` tuple, that `maskmin`/
  `maskmax` reach `PostfitExtractor` as `-1`/`-1`, that
  `GetPval("Run3TLA_rebinned")` is the p-value source used, that
  `plot_edm.py` is shelled out to via a plain `execute()` (not
  `execute_required()`, so its result is discarded), and that
  `datafirstbin` is computed as `FindBin(rangelow) - 1` from the fake
  histogram.
- `test_build_fit_extract_succeeds_for_masked_fit` — same doubles with
  `maskrange=(500, 600)`; asserts `--range SBLo_Run3TLA,SBHi_Run3TLA`
  reaches the actual quickFit command string, that `maskmin`/`maskmax`
  reach `PostfitExtractor` as `500`/`600`, and that
  `GetPval("Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned")` (the renormalized source) is
  selected instead of the unmasked one.

Both new tests force `os.path.exists()` to `True` via `monkeypatch` so
the resolution-binning-file branch (`createBinning.py`) is deterministic
and independent of what happens to already exist on disk for
`rangelow=481` — a real fixture file for that range exists in the
repository, which would otherwise make the test's behavior depend on
filesystem state rather than the code path under test.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git diff --stat -- python/` was empty
throughout this change — only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` was touched.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v -k build_fit_extract` →
  4 passed (2 pre-existing failure-path cases plus the 2 new
  successful-path cases), run against the unmodified
  `python/run_anaFit.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v` → 19 passed (full-file
  regression check).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 145 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (18 files unchanged) — one ruff
  F841 (unused `executed_commands` in the masked test) and one black
  reformat (long `monkeypatch.setattr(... raising=False)` line) were
  found and fixed while preparing this commit, both confined to the new
  test code itself.
- `git diff --stat` → only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` touched.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' tests/test_run_anaFit.py` → no output.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Chunk 6, Step A.
2. `git diff --stat` shows only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` — zero
   production files touched.
3. Both new tests assert the real, specific successful-path shape
   (return tuple, exact kwargs reaching the collaborators, exact p-value
   source string selected), not merely "does not raise."
4. Tests were run against the unmodified target file before any
   production change; results reported in full above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 6.B (extraction of `run_fit.py`) and Chunks 7 through 12 are open.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 6.B: extract `run_fit.py`

### Objective

Move `build_fit_extract()`, characterized in Chunk 6.A (commit
`e8f5467`), out of `run_anaFit.py` into a new `python/run_fit.py`, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 6.

### What changed

- `python/run_fit.py` created with `build_fit_extract()`, moved verbatim
  in logic and comments (including the commented-out dead alternatives -
  the `#bkgonly_opt` lines, the two commented-out `rebinfile=` variants,
  and the `#pfe.WriteRoot(postfitfile)` line). `from run_execution import
  execute, execute_required` at module level (flat sibling-import style)
  - the module needs both: `execute` for the `plot_edm.py` diagnostic
    call and the conditional `createBinning.py` call; `execute_required`
    for XMLReader and quickFit.
  - `import ROOT`, `from ExtractPostfitFromWS import PostfitExtractor`,
    `from ExtractFitParameters import FitParameterExtractor` are deferred
    inside `build_fit_extract` itself, placed immediately before the
    first `ROOT.TFile(...)` line - i.e. after both `execute_required`
    calls have already succeeded, matching the plan's import-placement
    rule. This is why the two failure-path tests (`_stops_after_
    xmlreader_failure`, `_stops_after_quickfit_failure`) need zero
    ROOT/sibling-module stubbing in their relocated form - both return
    before reaching the deferred import.
- `python/run_anaFit.py`: `build_fit_extract()`'s 106-line definition
  removed; `from ExtractPostfitFromWS import PostfitExtractor`, `from
  ExtractFitParameters import FitParameterExtractor`, and `import ROOT`
  removed from the top-level import block (confirmed by `grep -n "ROOT\.
  \|PostfitExtractor\|FitParameterExtractor" python/run_anaFit.py`
  before editing that every remaining reference to all three was inside
  the function being moved - none survive elsewhere in the coordinator).
  Replaced with `from run_fit import build_fit_extract` (flat
  sibling-import style). The two `run_anaFit()` call sites
  (`pval_global, ... = build_fit_extract(...)` and `pval_masked,_,_ =
  build_fit_extract(...)`) are unchanged - same name, now resolved via
  the import.
- `tests/test_run_fit.py` created with the 4 tests from Chunk 6.A
  (2 pre-existing failure-path, 2 new successful-path), relocated per the
  Test Relocation Rule with two documented, necessary exceptions (below).
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `python/run_fit.py` to
  `python_targets` and `tests/test_run_fit.py` to `test_targets`.

### Two Test Relocation Rule exceptions, both anticipated in Chunk 6.A and confirmed necessary

1. **Cross-module patch target.** `execute`/`execute_required` live in
   `run_execution.py`, a different module from where `build_fit_extract`
   now lives. The relocated tests patch `run_fit.execute_required`/
   `run_fit.execute` directly (via `monkeypatch.setattr(run_fit, ...)`),
   not `module.execute_required` as in the old `test_run_anaFit.py`
   version - the same necessary-consequence pattern already documented
   for Chunk 4.B (`run_masking.execute_required`) and Chunk 1.B.
2. **Deferred-import stubbing.** Because `ROOT`, `PostfitExtractor`, and
   `FitParameterExtractor` are now imported inside `build_fit_extract`
   itself rather than at module level, there is no `run_fit.ROOT`/
   `run_fit.PostfitExtractor` attribute to patch directly (unlike the old
   `test_run_anaFit.py` version, which patched attributes on the
   `exec_module`-loaded coordinator object that already had these names
   bound at import time). The two successful-path tests instead stub the
   modules those deferred imports resolve against, via
   `monkeypatch.setitem(sys.modules, "ROOT"/"ExtractPostfitFromWS"/
   "ExtractFitParameters", fake_module)` - the same technique already
   used for `run_provenance.collect_scientific_runtime`'s deferred
   `import ROOT` (Chunk 3.A/3.B) and `run_templates._seed_prefit_
   parameters`'s deferred `from PreFit import PreFitter` (Chunk 5.B). All
   assertions and expected values carried over unchanged from Chunk 6.A -
   only how the doubles are installed differs.

The two failure-path tests needed **neither** exception - they still
patch `run_fit.execute_required` only (exception 1 applies to both
failure and success tests equally) and never reach the deferred
ROOT/extractor imports at all, confirming the import placement is
correct per the plan's own acceptance check.

### Ruff/Black fixes required to register the new file (mechanical, zero behavior change)

Registering `run_fit.py` in `python_targets` was the first time this
exact code was lint-checked (it lived inside the un-gated
`run_anaFit.py` before):
- `def build_fit_extract(...)`'s 121-character single-line signature
  wrapped to one parameter per line.
- Two long `print(...)` string literals and the `quickfit_command`
  format string wrapped using implicit adjacent-string-literal
  concatenation - no change to the resulting string values.
- The `execute(f"python3 python/createBinning.py ...")` call wrapped
  across two lines (black then folded the two adjacent f-string literals
  back onto one line, still under 100 columns).
- Two `E501` findings on already-commented-out dead code
  (`#binningFileName = f"/afs/.../lbazzano/..."`,
  `#rebinfile=f"/afs/.../lbazzano/..."` x2) and one on a comment
  containing a long already-commented-out `print(...)` call marked
  `# noqa: E501` rather than reformatted, to avoid rewriting the exact
  text of preserved dead code for a line-length rule that only applies to
  live formatting; the "If we used masking..." comment was wrapped across
  two lines instead, since it is prose, not preserved code/data.
- `python -m black python/run_fit.py`: one further whitespace-only
  reformat (operator spacing, e.g. `_poi="-p %s" % poi` ->
  `_poi = "-p %s" % poi`).

None of these touch `run_anaFit.py`, which remains outside
`python_targets` (deferred to Chunk 8, per the established policy for
this file's pre-existing dead imports).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py -v` → 4 passed, in isolation.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 19 passed (4 + 15, matching the pre-move total of 19 exactly).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 145 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (20 files unchanged); exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed in 118.72s - **mandatory** for this chunk (Section 7:
  Chunks 4, 5, 8, and always before 12; this chunk rewrites the
  coordinator's actual fit/masking call path), matched against the
  frozen reference exactly.
- `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py` → 111 lines changed (1
  insertion, 110 deletions) - confirms only the import block and the
  function body were touched, nothing in `run_anaFit()` itself.
- `git diff --check` → passed (all trailing-whitespace hits are
  pre-existing lines in `run_anaFit.py`'s untouched body, not part of
  this diff).

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 6, Step B (this entry).
2. Step A is committed (`e8f5467`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are not import-line-only - two documented,
   necessary exceptions (cross-module patch target; deferred-import
   stubbing), both anticipated in Chunk 6.A; no assertion or expected
   value changed from Chunk 6.A.
5. `build_fit_extract` is covered by all 4 tests (2 failure-path,
   2 successful-path, unmasked and masked).
6. Confirmed by grep: `run_anaFit.py` actually imports and never
   redefines `build_fit_extract`.
7. Only this chunk's five changed/new files were staged.
8. All required Section 7 gates ran and passed, including the mandatory
   integration gate, output captured above.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunks 7 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 7 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 7.A: characterization tests for `main()`'s argument parsing and signal-name defaulting

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `main()`'s inline
`argparse` setup and default-signame logic in `python/run_anaFit.py`
before extracting them into `build_arg_parser()`/`normalize_signal_name()`
in `run_cli.py`, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 7. Neither
target function exists yet, so - per Chunk 5.A's precedent - this logic
is characterized indirectly, by calling the real `main()` (with
`run_anaFit` monkeypatched to capture its kwargs) rather than by
constructing a standalone parser that doesn't exist yet.

### Pre-change state

Only `test_main_propagates_analysis_status` touched `main()` before this
commit, and only to confirm it returns `run_anaFit()`'s status - it never
inspects parsed arguments or the derived `signame`. No dedicated test
existed for the default-naming branch (normal width, the `sigwidth ==
-999` Zprime branch, or the `7.0`-vs-`"7"` string-formatting quirk named
explicitly in the plan's own Chunk 7 text as a known "clean-up" trap), nor
for a representative full set of CLI flags parsing correctly.

### Target functions (as they exist today, inline in `main()`)

| Function-to-be | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build_arg_parser()` | none | `argparse.ArgumentParser` | none |
| `normalize_signal_name(sigmean, sigwidth, signame)` | `sigmean`, `sigwidth`, `signame` (possibly `None`/falsy) | `str` | none (pure) |

### Tests added

- `test_main_derives_default_signame_for_normal_width` — no `--signame`,
  `sigmean=1200`, `sigwidth=8.5` -> `"mean1200_width8.5"`.
- `test_main_preserves_integer_valued_float_width_in_default_signame` —
  `--sigwidth` omitted (default `7.` = `7.0`) -> `"mean1000_width7.0"`,
  pinning down the naive `"%s"`-style formatting the plan warns is easy to
  accidentally "clean up" into `"%g"`-style formatting (which would
  silently turn `7.0` into `7`) during extraction.
- `test_main_uses_zprime_naming_when_sigwidth_is_minus_999` —
  `sigwidth=-999`, `sigmean=1400` -> `"mR1400"`.
- `test_main_respects_explicit_signame_override` — an explicit
  `--signame` survives unchanged even when it doesn't match what the
  default-naming logic would have derived for the same
  `sigmean`/`sigwidth`.
- `test_main_parses_representative_j100_style_invocation` — mirrors an
  actual invocation shape from `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
  (`backgroundfile`/`signalfile` present, no `--signame`/`--dosignal`/
  `--dolimit`/`--doprefit`/`--sysfile`), asserting the full set of parsed
  values (including defaults `nsig="0,-1E6,1E6"`, `dosignal=False`,
  `dolimit=False`, `doprefit=False`, `systdict=None`) that reach
  `run_anaFit()`.

All five new tests pass `--folder` pointing at `tmp_path` to avoid the
side effect of `main()`'s `os.makedirs(args.folder)` creating a real
`run/` directory in the working tree (the pre-existing
`test_main_propagates_analysis_status` already relies on the untouched
default and was left as-is, per the Test Relocation Rule guidance below).

### Test Relocation Rule check for `test_main_propagates_analysis_status`

Per the plan's own explicit instruction: this test only exercises status
propagation through `main()` end-to-end (`run_anaFit` fully mocked, no
inspection of parsed arguments or `signame`) - it does not test parsing
behavior directly. It therefore stays in `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` and
is not moved to `tests/test_run_cli.py` in Step B.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git diff --stat -- python/` was empty
throughout this change - only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` was touched (5
new tests plus one shared capture helper, 220 lines).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v -k main` → 7 passed (2
  pre-existing status-propagation cases plus the 5 new parsing/naming
  cases), run against the unmodified `python/run_anaFit.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v` → 20 passed (full-file
  regression check).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 150 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (20 files unchanged).
- `git diff --stat` → only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` touched.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' tests/test_run_anaFit.py` → no output.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Chunk 7, Step A.
2. `git diff --stat` shows only `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` - zero
   production files touched.
3. Each new test asserts the real, specific derived value (`signame`,
   or the full set of parsed kwargs), not merely "does not raise."
4. Tests were run against the unmodified target file before any
   production change; results reported in full above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 7.B (extraction of `run_cli.py`) and Chunks 8 through 12 are open.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 7.B: extract `run_cli.py`

### Objective

Move `main()`'s inline `argparse` setup and default-signame logic,
characterized in Chunk 7.A (commit `9194c2a`), out of `python/run_anaFit.py`
into a new `python/run_cli.py`, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 7 - the plan's last extraction.

### What changed

- `python/run_cli.py` created with two functions:
  - `build_arg_parser()` - the 22 `parser.add_argument(...)` calls, moved
    verbatim (same flags, dests, types, defaults, help text, including the
    `default= None` stray-space quirk on `--signalfile`), wrapped in a
    thin function that returns the constructed parser instead of leaving
    it inline in `main()`.
  - `normalize_signal_name(sigmean, sigwidth, signame)` - the
    `if not args.signame: ...` default-naming block, moved verbatim and
    made pure (takes/returns `signame` instead of mutating `args`).
- `python/run_anaFit.py`: the 22-line `parser = argparse.ArgumentParser
  (...)` block and the 5-line default-signame `if` block both removed from
  `main()`; replaced with `parser = build_arg_parser()` and `args.signame =
  normalize_signal_name(args.sigmean, args.sigwidth, args.signame)`.
  `from run_cli import build_arg_parser, normalize_signal_name` added
  (flat sibling-import style). The top-level `argparse` name in the
  combined `import os,sys,re,argparse,subprocess,shutil` statement is now
  dead - left in place and documented, per the established policy for
  this not-yet-gated file's dead imports (`hashlib`/`platform`/
  `subprocess` since Chunk 3.B, `re` since Chunk 5.B), deferred to
  Chunk 8's coordinator slimming.
- `tests/test_run_cli.py` created with 5 tests, **rewritten to call
  `run_cli.build_arg_parser()`/`run_cli.normalize_signal_name()` directly**
  rather than through `main()` (see below).
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `python/run_cli.py` to
  `python_targets` and `tests/test_run_cli.py` to `test_targets`.

### Necessary test-relocation adaptation, and one deliberate non-move

Chunk 7.A's 5 characterization tests called `module.main([...])` end-to-end
(mocking `run_anaFit` and capturing its kwargs) because no standalone
function existed yet to call directly - the same situation as Chunk 5.A.
Now that `build_arg_parser()`/`normalize_signal_name()` exist, the 4 tests
whose whole point is one of those two functions' own behavior were
rewritten to call them directly and split accordingly:
- `test_main_derives_default_signame_for_normal_width`,
  `test_main_preserves_integer_valued_float_width_in_default_signame`,
  `test_main_uses_zprime_naming_when_sigwidth_is_minus_999`,
  `test_main_respects_explicit_signame_override` -> became
  `test_normalize_signal_name_derives_default_for_normal_width`,
  `test_normalize_signal_name_preserves_integer_valued_float_width`,
  `test_normalize_signal_name_uses_zprime_naming_when_sigwidth_is_minus_999`,
  `test_normalize_signal_name_respects_explicit_override` in
  `tests/test_run_cli.py`, calling `run_cli.normalize_signal_name(sigmean,
  sigwidth, signame)` directly - no `main()`, no module loading, no
  `tmp_path`/`--folder` needed at all, since the pure function has no
  filesystem side effects. Same expected values as Chunk 7.A, unchanged.
- `test_main_parses_representative_j100_style_invocation` was **split
  rather than moved wholesale**: its flag-parsing assertions (datafile,
  backgroundfile, rangelow/rangehigh, dosignal/dolimit/doprefit,
  sigmean/sigwidth, nsig default, maskthreshold, sysfile) became
  `test_build_arg_parser_parses_representative_j100_style_invocation` in
  `tests/test_run_cli.py`, calling `run_cli.build_arg_parser()` directly
  and asserting `args.signame is None` (the bare parser leaves it
  unset - deriving a default is `normalize_signal_name()`'s job, not the
  parser's). Its `systdict` assertion belongs to neither new function -
  loading `--sysfile` into `systdict` is separate logic that **stays
  inline in `main()`** (out of scope for this chunk's two named target
  functions) - so the original test **was kept in
  `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`**, unmoved, now serving explicitly as
  `main()`'s own wiring/smoke test: that `build_arg_parser()` ->
  `parser.parse_args()` -> `normalize_signal_name()` -> the kwargs
  actually passed to `run_anaFit()` are still correctly connected, plus
  the one piece of CLI logic that remains inline. This is a documented,
  necessary Test Relocation Rule exception, not an oversight: the test's
  coverage spans two extracted functions and one still-inline block at
  once, so it could not honestly become an import-line-only move into
  either module.

### Ruff/Black fixes required to register the new file (mechanical, zero behavior change)

Registering `run_cli.py` in `python_targets` was the first time this
exact code was lint-checked (it lived inline in the un-gated
`run_anaFit.py`'s `main()` before): every `add_argument(...)` call
exceeded the 100-column limit (up to 178 characters) and was reflowed by
`python -m black python/run_cli.py` into one-argument-per-line or
single-line form as each call's length required; two calls remained
exactly at 99-100 columns after formatting and needed no further change.
No `ruff check` findings beyond what black's reformat already resolved.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_cli.py -v` → 5 passed, in isolation.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_cli.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 21 passed (5 new + 16 remaining in `test_run_anaFit.py`, matching the
  pre-move total of 21 exactly: Chunk 7.A's 20 plus one - Chunk 7.A had
  added 5 to a pre-existing 15, Step B nets the same 21 by moving 4 out
  and keeping 1 as the coordinator's wiring test).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 151 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (22 files unchanged); exit code 0.
- `git diff --stat -- python/run_anaFit.py` → 32 lines changed (4
  insertions, 28 deletions).
- `git diff --check` → passed (all trailing-whitespace hits are
  pre-existing lines in `run_anaFit.py`'s untouched body).
- The mandatory J100/J50 integration gate was **not** rerun for this
  chunk: `build_arg_parser()`/`normalize_signal_name()` touch no real
  branch conditions in the scientific fit/masking pipeline (pure CLI
  parsing and string formatting), matching the precedent set by Chunk 2.B
  (`run_manifest.py`) and Chunk 3.B (`run_provenance.py`), neither of
  which reran it either - Section 7 reserves the mandatory rerun for
  Chunks 4, 5, 8, and always before 12.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 7, Step B (this entry) - the plan's last extraction chunk.
2. Step A is committed (`9194c2a`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are not import-line-only - the call target
   changed from `module.main(...)` to `run_cli.build_arg_parser()`/
   `run_cli.normalize_signal_name(...)` directly for 5 tests, and one
   test was deliberately kept unmoved as a documented exception (its
   coverage spans a still-inline block); no assertion or expected value
   changed from Chunk 7.A.
5. Both new functions are covered: `build_arg_parser()` (1 direct test
   plus indirect coverage via `main()`'s own wiring test) and
   `normalize_signal_name()` (4 tests covering normal width, the
   float-formatting quirk, the Zprime branch, and explicit override).
6. Confirmed by grep: `run_anaFit.py` actually imports and never
   redefines `build_arg_parser`/`normalize_signal_name`; no remaining
   `argparse.` call sites outside the dead top-level import.
7. Only this chunk's five changed/new files were staged.
8. All required Section 7 gates ran and passed; the mandatory integration
   gate was correctly judged not applicable to this chunk (see above),
   matching established precedent for non-branch-touching chunks.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunk 8 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 8 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open. All seven
module extractions (Chunks 1-7) are now complete and verified;
`python/run_anaFit.py` is 254 lines. Chunk 8 (coordinator slimming and
dependency-direction verification) is next.

## 2026-09-03: Fix run_cli.py description placeholder and a wrong test return annotation (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### What Copilot found

Two findings on the Chunk 7.B commit (`fdee1ae`):

1. `python/run_cli.py:5` (also flagged, incorrectly, as recurring on line
   53 - no second occurrence actually exists there, checked directly):
   `argparse.ArgumentParser(description="%prog [options]")` uses the
   optparse-era `%prog` placeholder, which `argparse` does not substitute
   in `description` - it would appear literally in `--help` output.
   `argparse`'s own placeholder is `%(prog)s`.
2. `tests/test_run_fit.py:135-138`:
   `_prepare_build_fit_extract_success_doubles()` is annotated `-> None`
   but actually `return`s `executed_commands` (a `list[str]`).

### Verification performed before fixing

- Finding 2 (return-type mismatch) is directly visible by reading the
  function body against its own signature - confirmed by inspection, no
  further check needed.
- Finding 1 required checking whether `argparse` actually substitutes
  `%(prog)s` (unlike `%prog`, which is optparse-specific) - confirmed
  empirically: constructing two parsers with `description="%prog
  [options]"` and `description="%(prog)s [options]"` respectively and
  rendering each showed the first prints the placeholder text unchanged,
  the second substitutes the real program name. This is a real,
  user-visible bug (a person running `--help` would see the literal
  string `%prog [options]` instead of a description).
- **Scope check**: `git blame`/direct comparison against the pre-Tier-3
  commit (`5b23af8`) confirmed `'%prog [options]'` is not something this
  refactor introduced - it was already present, verbatim, in the original
  `run_anaFit.py`'s inline `main()`, moved as-is into `run_cli.py` by
  Chunk 7.B per the "move verbatim" policy. A repo-wide `grep -rn
  "%prog"` additionally found the exact same `%prog [options]` pattern in
  **29 other files** across `python/` (essentially every script in the
  repo using `argparse`/`optparse`), confirming this is a long-standing,
  repo-wide copy-paste convention, not something specific to
  `run_anaFit.py`. Per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s own guardrail
  ("Fixing pre-existing, unrelated issues noticed along the way ... note
  them in the activity log if seen again, do not fix them unless a chunk
  says to"), the other 29 occurrences are explicitly **out of scope** and
  were not touched - Tier 3's scope is the four named files, not a
  repo-wide sweep. This one occurrence is fixed because it is literally
  the line Copilot flagged in this PR's diff and is required to complete
  the merge review, matching this project's established practice for
  addressing real PR review findings (e.g. the `should_mask()` NaN fix).

### A second, unrelated pre-existing bug found while verifying the fix (noted, not fixed)

Confirming the `%(prog)s` substitution end-to-end via
`parser.print_help()` crashed with `ValueError: unsupported format
character ')' ... `, unrelated to the `description` fix itself. Root
cause: the `--sigwidth` argument's `help=` text - `"Width of signal
Gaussian for s+b fit (in %). If -999 dealing with Zprime samples."` -
contains a bare `%` that `argparse`'s help-string `%`-expansion (used for
things like `%(default)s`) chokes on when rendering the *full* help
output. This exact string was confirmed present, unchanged, at the
pre-Tier-3 commit (`5b23af8`) too - calling `run_anaFit.py --help` (or
now `run_cli.build_arg_parser().print_help()`) has been broken since
before this refactor started. Per the same plan guardrail cited above,
this is noted here rather than fixed; the new regression test below
verifies the `description` fix in isolation (via the formatter's
`add_text()`/`format_help()`, not `parser.print_help()`) specifically to
avoid tripping over this unrelated, out-of-scope crash.

### Fixes

- `python/run_cli.py`: `description="%prog [options]"` ->
  `description="%(prog)s [options]"`.
- `tests/test_run_fit.py`: `_prepare_build_fit_extract_success_doubles()`'s
  return annotation `-> None` -> `-> list[str]`.
- `tests/test_run_cli.py`:
  `test_build_arg_parser_description_uses_argparse_prog_placeholder`
  added - asserts `"%prog" not in parser.description` and that rendering
  the description through the formatter substitutes the real `prog`
  value. Confirmed to fail against the pre-fix `"%prog [options]"` string
  (`AssertionError: assert '%prog' not in '%prog [options]'`) and pass
  against the fix.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_cli.py -v` → 6 passed (5 pre-existing
  plus the new regression test).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py tests/test_run_cli.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 26 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 152 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (22 files unchanged).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- The mandatory integration gate was not rerun: neither fix touches the
  fit/masking pipeline (a CLI help-text placeholder and a test-only type
  annotation), matching the same judgment already applied to Chunk 7.B
  itself.

### Scope

Only `python/run_cli.py`, `tests/test_run_fit.py`, and
`tests/test_run_cli.py` touched. Not folded into Chunk 8 - a review
finding on already-pushed Chunk 7 work, fixed immediately as its own
commit, per this project's established practice for Copilot review
findings.

## 2026-09-03: Fix the sigwidth help-string crash and a rangehigh help typo (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### What Copilot found

Two more findings on `python/run_cli.py`, following up on the previous
commit (`850b35b`):

1. (Medium) The `--sigwidth` help text contains a literal `%`, which
   `argparse` treats as a format marker when rendering full `--help`
   output; this raises `ValueError` and breaks help generation in normal
   CLI usage. Suggested fix: escape it as `%%`.
2. (Low) The `--rangehigh` help text reads `"End Start of fit range (in
   GeV)"` - an apparent accidental duplication/typo, confusing in `--help`
   output.

### Correction to the previous commit's scoping decision

The previous commit (`850b35b`) already found and *documented* this exact
`--sigwidth` crash while verifying the `%prog` fix, but judged it
out-of-scope as a "pre-existing, unrelated issue noticed incidentally"
per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s guardrail, and left it unfixed with
a comment explaining why. Copilot has now flagged the same line directly
as a blocking finding on this PR. Per this project's established
practice for review findings (fix what Copilot raises on the PR, not a
repo-wide sweep), this is the correct trigger to fix it: unlike the other
28 occurrences of the unrelated `%prog` pattern found elsewhere in the
repo (still correctly left untouched - a repo-wide sweep remains out of
scope), this line lives in `run_cli.py`, a file created by this PR, and
is directly, specifically flagged as blocking approval. The guardrail's
purpose is to prevent scope creep into unrelated files noticed
in passing, not to leave a confirmed, reviewer-flagged crash in the code
this PR is introducing.

### Verification performed before fixing

- Confirmed the crash directly: `run_cli.build_arg_parser().print_help()`
  raised `ValueError: unsupported format character ')' (0x29) at index
  42` before the fix (matches the trace already captured in the previous
  commit's activity-log entry).
- Confirmed the `--rangehigh` typo by direct inspection - the text is
  exactly `"End Start of fit range (in GeV)"`, evidently `"End "`
  mistakenly prepended to a copy of `--rangelow`'s own `"Start of fit
  range (in GeV)"` help text.
- After fixing, confirmed `parser.format_help()` renders the full help
  text successfully (no exception), and that the escaped `%%` renders as
  a single literal `%` in the output: `"Width of signal Gaussian for s+b
  fit (in %). If -999 dealing with Zprime samples."` appears verbatim in
  the rendered text - the escaping changes only how the help string is
  written in source, not what a user sees.

### Fixes

- `python/run_cli.py`:
  - `--sigwidth`'s `help=` string: `"...(in %). If -999..."` ->
    `"...(in %%). If -999..."`.
  - `--rangehigh`'s `help=` string: `"End Start of fit range (in GeV)"`
    -> `"End of fit range (in GeV)"`.
- `tests/test_run_cli.py`:
  - `test_build_arg_parser_format_help_does_not_raise` added - calls
    `parser.format_help()` directly (the full render, not the isolated
    formatter workaround the previous commit used to sidestep this exact
    crash) and asserts the expected wording appears. Confirmed to raise
    `ValueError` against the pre-fix `%` (not `%%`) and pass against the
    fix.
  - `test_build_arg_parser_rangehigh_help_does_not_duplicate_start` added
    - asserts the exact expected help string. Confirmed to fail against
    the pre-fix `"End Start of fit range (in GeV)"` text and pass against
    the fix.
  - `test_build_arg_parser_description_uses_argparse_prog_placeholder`
    (added in the previous commit) simplified: now calls
    `parser.format_help()` directly instead of the isolated
    `formatter.add_text()`/`format_help()` workaround, since the full
    render no longer crashes - the workaround and its explanatory comment
    are no longer needed and were removed.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_cli.py -v` → 8 passed (3 new/changed
  plus 5 unchanged).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_cli.py tests/test_run_fit.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 28 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 154 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (22 files unchanged) - one further
  black reformat collapsed `--rangehigh`'s `add_argument(...)` back onto
  a single line, now under 100 columns with the shorter help text.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- The mandatory integration gate was not rerun: this fix touches only CLI
  help text (`argparse` `help=`/`description=` strings), not the
  fit/masking pipeline, matching the same judgment already applied to
  Chunk 7.B and the previous Copilot-fix commit.

### Scope

Only `python/run_cli.py` and `tests/test_run_cli.py` touched. Not folded
into Chunk 8 - a review finding on already-pushed Chunk 7 work, fixed
immediately as its own commit, per this project's established practice
for Copilot review findings.

## 2026-09-03: Fix optional range args and ambiguous command-string concatenation (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### What Copilot found

Two more findings on the newly introduced Chunk 6/7 modules:

1. (Medium) `python/run_cli.py`: `--rangelow`/`--rangehigh` are parsed as
   optional, but `run_anaFit.run_anaFit()` immediately does `rangehigh -
   rangelow` arithmetic, so omitting either would parse to `None` and
   crash later with a confusing `TypeError` instead of a clear `argparse`
   usage error at parse time. Suggested fix: mark both `required=True`.
2. (Low) `python/run_fit.py`: `xmlreader_command`'s construction relies on
   implicit adjacent-string-literal concatenation with mixed quoting
   (`"..." '...'`), which is easy to misread/edit. Suggested fix: a single
   f-string, keeping the exact runtime command text unchanged.

### Verification performed before fixing

- Confirmed finding 1's premise by inspection: `run_anaFit()`'s first
  real line of work is `nbins=rangehigh - rangelow`, unconditionally.
  Neither flag has a `default=`.
- Checked whether this was introduced by Tier 3 or pre-existing: it was
  already present, verbatim, in the original `run_anaFit.py` (moved as-is
  by Chunk 7.B). Notably, the **sibling** script
  `python/run_injections_anaFit.py` (out of Tier 3's scope, untouched by
  this refactor) already marks its own `--rangelow`/`--rangehigh` as
  `required=True` for the exact same reason - confirming this is an
  established convention elsewhere in the codebase that `run_anaFit.py`'s
  own CLI simply never had, not a new requirement being invented here.
- Checked real-world impact: both `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` and
  `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh` (the only production callers) already pass
  `--rangelow`/`--rangehigh` unconditionally - `required=True` changes
  nothing for the canonical workflows, it only changes what happens for
  an invocation that omits them (a clear `argparse` error instead of a
  crash two functions later).
- Found one existing test that *would* break:
  `test_main_propagates_analysis_status` in `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`
  omits both flags (it mocks `run_anaFit` entirely, so the resulting
  `None` values were never actually used) - updated to pass them, per the
  same practice used for prior fixes that require a compensating test
  update to stay green.
- Verified finding 2's suggested rewrite is byte-identical to the
  original by direct comparison in a Python shell: constructing the old
  three-piece expression and the new f-string with the same `topfile`
  value and comparing the results confirmed `old == new`.

### Fixes

- `python/run_cli.py`: `--rangelow` and `--rangehigh` both gained
  `required=True` (and were reflowed to `black`'s multi-line
  `add_argument(...)` form, since the line no longer fits one line with
  the new keyword).
- `python/run_fit.py`: `xmlreader_command`'s construction rewritten from
  `("...%s " '...') % topfile` to a single f-string
  `f'...XMLReader -x {topfile} -o "logy integral" --minimizerStrategy 0'`
  - same runtime string, single unambiguous literal.
- `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`: `test_main_propagates_analysis_status`'s
  args list gained `--rangelow 481 --rangehigh 3000`.
- `tests/test_run_cli.py`:
  - The representative-invocation args list was pulled out into a shared
    module-level `_REPRESENTATIVE_ARGS` constant (previously duplicated
    inline), used by both the existing parse test and the new one below.
  - `test_build_arg_parser_requires_range_flags` added (parametrized over
    both flags) - builds a valid arg list, removes one flag/value pair,
    and asserts `parser.parse_args(...)` raises `SystemExit` with the
    missing flag named in the printed error. Confirmed to fail
    (`DID NOT RAISE SystemExit`) against the pre-fix optional flags and
    pass against the fix.
- `tests/test_run_fit.py`:
  `test_build_fit_extract_stops_after_xmlreader_failure` extended to
  capture and assert the exact rendered `xmlreader_command` string,
  pinning down that the f-string rewrite produces byte-identical output.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_cli.py -v` → 10 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py tests/test_run_cli.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 30 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 156 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (22 files unchanged).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- The mandatory integration gate was not rerun: `run_fit.py`'s change is
  proven byte-identical output (verified above and pinned by the new
  test), and `run_cli.py`'s `required=True` change does not alter the
  canonical J100/J50 invocations at all (both already pass these flags) -
  neither fix changes fit/masking behavior for the authoritative
  workflows, matching the judgment already applied to the two preceding
  Copilot-fix commits on this PR.

### Scope

Only `python/run_cli.py`, `python/run_fit.py`, `tests/test_run_cli.py`,
`tests/test_run_fit.py`, and `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` touched. Not
folded into Chunk 8 - review findings on already-pushed Chunk 6/7 work,
fixed immediately as their own commit, per this project's established
practice for Copilot review findings.

## 2026-09-03: Fix silent output-file collision when fitresultfile lacks the FitResult token (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### What Copilot found

`python/run_fit.py` (High severity): `postfitfile`/`parameterfile`/
`logfile`/`edmplot` are all derived from `fitresultfile` via
`fitresultfile.replace("FitResult", <other token>)` - an undocumented
filename contract. If `fitresultfile`'s basename does not contain
`"FitResult"` (the CLI currently accepts any string via `--outputfile`,
with no such validation), every one of those substitutions is a no-op,
so `postfitfile` and `parameterfile` both silently collapse back to
`fitresultfile` itself; `PostfitExtractor`/`FitParameterExtractor` then
both open that same path in `RECREATE` mode, overwriting the quickFit
result twice. Separately, because the substitution operates on the
*entire path* rather than just the filename, a parent directory
component that happens to contain `"FitResult"` gets rewritten too.
Copilot's ask: validate the basename before launching quickFit, and
derive each sibling output by transforming only that basename.

### Verification performed before fixing

- Confirmed the collapse-to-self claim by direct reasoning through
  `str.replace()` semantics for a non-matching input (e.g.
  `"fit-result.root"`): every `.replace("FitResult", ...)` call is a
  no-op, so `postfitfile == parameterfile == fitresultfile`.
- Confirmed this predates Tier 3 - the exact same `.replace("FitResult",
  ...)` pattern, operating on the whole `fitresultfile` path, was already
  present in the original `run_anaFit.py`, moved verbatim into
  `run_fit.py` by Chunk 6.B. Unlike the `%prog` pattern (found duplicated
  in 29 unrelated files and correctly left untouched), this logic lives
  entirely inside `run_fit.py`, a file this PR created - the same
  reasoning already applied to the `--rangelow`/`--rangehigh` and
  `xmlreader_command` fixes earlier on this PR justifies fixing it here,
  not sweeping the rest of the repository.
- Checked real-world impact: both `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` and
  `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh` always construct `--outputfile` as
  `${folder}/FitResult_anaFit_...root` - the canonical workflows are
  unaffected either way; this is a latent bug reachable only via a
  manual invocation with a non-conforming `--outputfile`.
- Reproduced the parent-directory-rewrite half of the bug directly: ran
  `build_fit_extract(..., fitresultfile="run/FitResult_stage/
  FitResult_anaFit.root")` against the pre-fix code and observed
  `postfitfile` come back as `"run/PostFit_stage/PostFit_anaFit.root"` -
  the `FitResult_stage` directory segment was rewritten to `PostFit_stage`
  along with the filename, confirmed via the new regression test (below)
  failing against the pre-fix code before the production fix was applied.

### Fix

`python/run_fit.py`: `os.path.split(fitresultfile)` splits the path once
into `fitresult_dir`/`fitresult_name`. A validation check (raising
`ValueError` if `"FitResult"` is not in `fitresult_name`) runs where
`logfile`/`edmplot` were already being derived - after XMLReader (which
never touches `fitresultfile`) but **before** quickFit launches, per
Copilot's ask. All four derived filenames (`logfile`, `edmplot`,
`postfitfile`, `parameterfile`) now transform only `fitresult_name` and
rejoin with `fitresult_dir` via `os.path.join(...)`, instead of
transforming the whole path. For every filename shape actually used
today (no directory component, or a directory with no incidental
`"FitResult"` substring), this produces byte-identical output to the
original code - confirmed by the three pre-existing success-path tests
passing unmodified against the fix.

### Tests added

- `tests/test_run_fit.py::test_build_fit_extract_rejects_fitresultfile_without_fitresult_token` -
  asserts `ValueError` (matching `'must contain "FitResult"'`) for
  `fitresultfile="fit-result.root"`, and that quickFit's
  `execute_required` call is never reached. Confirmed to pass silently
  (no exception) against the pre-fix code and raise correctly against the
  fix.
- `tests/test_run_fit.py::test_build_fit_extract_derives_siblings_from_basename_only` -
  `fitresultfile="run/FitResult_stage/FitResult_anaFit.root"`; asserts
  `postfitfile`/`parameterfile` come back as
  `"run/FitResult_stage/PostFit_anaFit.root"`/
  `"run/FitResult_stage/FitParameters_anaFit.root"` (directory segment
  preserved) and that the `plot_edm.py` diagnostic command embeds the
  correctly-derived `logfile`/`edmplot` paths too. Confirmed to fail
  against the pre-fix code with the directory segment corrupted to
  `"PostFit_stage"` (see above), and pass against the fix.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py -v` → 6 passed (4 pre-existing
  plus the 2 new regression tests).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py tests/test_run_cli.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v`
  → 32 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 158 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (22 files unchanged).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed in 160.02s, matching the frozen reference exactly - rerun as
  extra confidence, since this fix changes the exact filename-derivation
  logic inside `build_fit_extract()` (the same function Chunk 6.B's own
  commit required the mandatory gate for), confirming the fix is
  byte-identical for the real J100/J50 filename shapes, not just the
  unit-test fixtures above.

### Scope

Only `python/run_fit.py` and `tests/test_run_fit.py` touched. Not folded
into Chunk 8 - a review finding on already-pushed Chunk 6 work, fixed
immediately as its own commit, per this project's established practice
for Copilot review findings.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 8: coordinator slimming and dependency-direction verification

### Objective

With Chunks 1-7 done (all seven module extractions complete, plus four
GitHub Copilot review-finding fixes), verify `run_anaFit()` now reads as
an orchestration of calls into the seven new modules, not a container for
their logic, and register `python/run_anaFit.py` itself with the Tier 2
quality gate. Per the plan, this is a checkpoint, not a new extraction -
no new target function exists, so guardrail 3's characterization-first
pattern does not apply; there is nothing new to characterize before
modifying, only a verification pass over work already characterized and
extracted in Chunks 1-7. Delivered as a single commit.

### Re-read of `run_anaFit.py` top to bottom

Confirmed the file contains only: imports, `run_anaFit()`, `main()`, and
the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard - no extracted logic was copied
rather than moved, and no partial extractions remain. Verified formally
via the plan's own acceptance-check script (below).

### Dead imports removed (live gate failures once registered)

Registering `python/run_anaFit.py` in `python_targets` for the first time
surfaced imports that were dead but never checked while the file was
un-gated - the same "deferred to Chunk 8" imports named explicitly across
Chunks 3.B (`hashlib`, `platform`), 5.B (`re`), and implicitly since
7.B (`argparse`), plus one found only now:
- `re`, `argparse`, `subprocess`, `hashlib`, `platform`, and
  `from pathlib import Path` - all confirmed dead by grepping for every
  live (non-comment) use in the file; none found. Removed.
- `execute_required` (imported from `run_execution`, alongside `execute`)
  - confirmed dead: `run_anaFit.py` itself only ever calls `execute(...)`
    directly (for the quickLimit command); `execute_required` is used
    inside the sub-modules (`run_masking.py`, `run_templates.py`,
    `run_fit.py`), not the coordinator. This has been dead since
    Chunk 1.B's own extraction, simply never linted until now. Removed.
- `covariancedict = None` in `main()` - a local variable assigned but
  never used or passed to `run_anaFit()` (confirmed: `main()`'s call to
  `run_anaFit()` never includes `covariancedict=...`). This pairs with a
  pre-existing, still-commented `#if args.covariancefile: ...` stub for a
  CLI flag that was never actually added to `run_cli.py`'s
  `build_arg_parser()` - an unimplemented feature stub, not something
  Tier 3 is building out (out of scope per Section 3). Removed the dead
  assignment; left the commented stub as-is with an explanatory comment
  added above it, rather than deleting a decade-old TODO-shaped comment
  outright.

`os`, `sys`, `shutil`, `json`, and every `from run_*` import were
confirmed live (each has at least one real call site) and kept unchanged.

### Ruff/Black fixes required to register the file (mechanical, zero behavior change)

First time this exact code (the original coordinator, minus what Chunks
1-7 already moved out) was ever lint-checked:
- Import block sorted/blank-line-separated (`I001`, auto-fixed).
- A literal tab character mixed with spaces in one indented comment line
  (`if sigwidth == -999: <TAB><SPACES># poi=...`) and in one closing-paren
  line of a multi-line call (seven literal tabs before the paren) -
  both replaced with plain spaces (`W191`/`E101`).
- All `W291`/`W293` trailing/blank-line whitespace, auto-fixed.
- One genuinely dead local variable (`covariancedict`, `F841`) - removed,
  as above.
- Several long-line (`E501`) findings:
  - Two long "####...####" debug `print(...)` banner strings and three
    already-commented-out dead-code lines (a `shutil.copy2` pair, a
    `FindBHWindow.py` invocation, and one line of a commented-out `sed`
    command block) marked `# noqa: E501` rather than reformatted, per the
    same precedent established in Chunk 6.B's `run_fit.py` - preserving
    live debug output and dead-code text verbatim rather than rewriting
    strings for a line-length rule.
  - Two genuinely long *live* lines given real wraps, both verified
    byte-identical to the original by direct comparison in a Python shell
    before applying: the `maskrange=(int(...), int(...))` kwarg (split
    across three lines) and the live `quickLimit` command string
    (rewritten via implicit adjacent-string-literal concatenation,
    mirroring the identical technique already used for
    `run_fit.py`'s `xmlreader_command`/`quickfit_command` in Chunk 6.B
    and the Copilot-fix commit for `xmlreader_command`). The still-
    commented-out `#rtv=execute(...)` sibling line (the disabled
    `timeout --foreground 1800` variant) was left as dead-code text with
    `# noqa: E501`, not touched.
- `python -m black python/run_anaFit.py`: one further, large
  whitespace-only reformat - this file's original formatting (comma-
  packed single-line imports, tight `key=value` spacing, unindented
  multi-line call continuations) had never been through `black` before,
  unlike every other module extracted so far, which each got this same
  one-time reformat pass when first registered (Chunks 3.B, 5.B, 6.B,
  7.B). No `ast` diff beyond whitespace/formatting - confirmed by all
  tests below passing unchanged before and after.

### Acceptance check (run verbatim from the plan)

```
$ wc -l python/run_anaFit.py
292 python/run_anaFit.py

$ python -c "import ast, pathlib; tree = ast.parse(pathlib.Path('python/run_anaFit.py').read_text()); print(sorted({n.name for n in tree.body if isinstance(n, (ast.FunctionDef, ast.AsyncFunctionDef))}))"
['main', 'run_anaFit']

$ grep -rn "^from run_anaFit import\|^import run_anaFit" python/run_execution.py python/run_manifest.py python/run_provenance.py python/run_masking.py python/run_templates.py python/run_fit.py python/run_cli.py
(no output - confirmed no reverse dependency)

$ grep -n "python/run_anaFit.py" scripts/quality_check.py
        "python/run_anaFit.py",
```

292 lines - larger than the plan's original "~60-100 lines" estimate
(Section 4's draft written before Chunks 1-7's actual signatures/kwargs
were known), but the acceptance check does not assert a line count, only
that the AST contains exactly `{'main', 'run_anaFit'}` - satisfied. The
extra size versus the estimate is legitimate orchestration: the masking
branch (BumpHunter refit, XML template copying/blinding, second
`build_fit_extract` call) and the quickLimit branch are real coordinator
logic that stays in `run_anaFit()` by design (Chunks 1-7's scope was the
seven named modules, not further decomposing the coordinator's own
control flow), plus `main()`'s CLI wiring and the still-inline
`--sysfile`-to-`systdict` logic (Chunk 7.B's own documented scope
boundary).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v` → 16 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 158 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (23 files unchanged) - the first
  time `run_anaFit.py` itself has ever passed this gate.
- `python -m pytest tests/ -m "not requires_analysis_dependencies and not (integration and requires_root)" -v`
  → 159 passed, 4 deselected. Section 2's original baseline (Chunk 0,
  commit range start) was 120 passed under the same filter - comfortably
  exceeds baseline plus the net new tests added across Chunks 1-8 and the
  four Copilot-fix commits.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
  → 2 passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`
  → 1 passed in 152.04s, matching the frozen reference exactly - mandatory
  for this chunk per Section 7 (explicitly named alongside Chunks 4, 5,
  and always before 12).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `git status` → only `python/run_anaFit.py` and `scripts/quality_check.py`
  modified; no untracked repository-root artifacts from test execution.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Verification checklist)

1. Chunk 8 - a checkpoint/verification commit, not a characterization-
   then-extraction pair; no Step A/Step B split applies (guardrail 3
   explicitly does not apply here, per the plan's own Chunk 8 text).
2. `run_anaFit.py` re-read top to bottom; contains only imports,
   `run_anaFit()`, `main()`, and the `__main__` guard - confirmed by the
   plan's own AST-based acceptance check.
3. No dependency-direction violation: none of the seven extracted modules
   imports back from `run_anaFit.py` (confirmed by grep, above).
4. `python/run_anaFit.py` registered in `scripts/quality_check.py`'s
   `python_targets`; full gate passes with zero remaining findings in the
   coordinator itself.
5. Every fix in this commit is either a proven-dead-code removal (grepped
   for zero live uses before removing) or a proven byte-identical
   reformat/wrap (verified in a Python shell before applying, or a pure
   whitespace/import-order `black`/`ruff --fix` pass) - no behavior
   change; confirmed by the coordinator's own 16 tests and the full
   159-test suite passing unchanged.
6. Only this chunk's two changed files were staged.
7. All required Section 7 gates ran, including the mandatory integration
   gate, which passed and matched the frozen reference (above).
8. `git diff --check` passed; no untracked artifacts remain.
9. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
   section).
10. Chunks 9 through 12 remain open, listed below.
11. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 9 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open. All eight
module-extraction and coordinator-slimming chunks (1-8) are now complete
and verified.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 9.A: characterization tests for `plot_minuit_continuous`

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `plot_minuit_continuous()`
in `plot_edm.py` (repository root) before splitting it into
`parse_minuit_edm_log()` and `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 9. `plot_edm.py` has no existing
tests at all, so this is a first-ever characterization, not a relocation.

### A discrepancy between the plan and the actual dev environment, found before writing any test

The plan's Section 4.2 import-placement table lists `plot_edm.py` as
"already ROOT-free — matplotlib only" and places its imports "top-level"
- implicitly assuming matplotlib (and, transitively, the also-imported
`numpy`) is available wherever this file's tests run. Checked directly:
neither `matplotlib` nor `numpy` is installed in this repository's dev
venv, and neither appears in `requirements-dev-lock.txt` or
`requirements-dev.txt`. Confirmed by direct attempt:
`python -c "import matplotlib.pyplot"` and `python -c "import numpy"`
both raise `ModuleNotFoundError`, and `import plot_edm` itself fails at
module level for the same reason - **the current dev venv cannot import
this file at all**, today, regardless of any refactor.

This is the same situation this plan has already handled for ROOT
throughout Chunks 3, 5, and 6: `plot_edm.py` is only ever invoked as a
subprocess from within the LCG/CVMFS scientific environment (see
`run_fit.py`'s `execute("python plot_edm.py %s %s" % (logfile,
edmplot))` call) - the same environment that provides ROOT, not the
pytest dev venv. The plan's "top-level" placement note for this file's
imports is therefore corrected here: **Step B will defer `import
matplotlib.pyplot as plt` inside `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`** (the one
function that touches it), matching the import-placement rule already
applied to every ROOT-touching function elsewhere in this plan, not left
top-level as the draft table said. This test file stubs
`sys.modules["matplotlib"]`/`["matplotlib.pyplot"]`/`["matplotlib.cm"]`/
`["numpy"]` the same way `test_run_anaFit.py`/`test_run_provenance.py`
already stub `ROOT`, so these characterization tests exercise real,
verifiable behavior (see below) without needing matplotlib installed.

### A second discrepancy: two of the three top-level imports are already dead

`import numpy as np` and `import matplotlib.cm as cm` are both present in
`plot_edm.py` today but neither `np.` nor `cm.` appears anywhere in the
function body - confirmed by direct grep. Only `matplotlib.pyplot` (as
`plt`) is actually used. Noted here for Step B (removing genuinely dead
imports on newly-registered files is this project's established
practice, e.g. Chunk 8's `run_anaFit.py` cleanup) rather than acted on in
this characterization-only commit.

### Target function (as it exists today)

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plot_minuit_continuous(filename, outname)` | `filename: str` (quickFit log path), `outname: str` | `None` | reads `filename`; prints "Error: The file was not found." and `sys.exit(1)` if missing; prints "No matching data found." and returns early if the log has no Minuit trace lines; otherwise builds and saves a matplotlib figure to `outname` via `plt.savefig(outname, bbox_inches="tight")` |

### How the fake `matplotlib.pyplot` was built, and what it actually proves

The stub module records every `savefig(outname, **kwargs)` call and
**actually writes bytes to `outname`** (a real file, not just a recorded
call), so file-existence/non-emptiness assertions below are testing a
real filesystem effect, not merely "the stub was invoked." Every other
`pyplot` function used (`figure`, `plot`, `axhline`, `yscale`, `xscale`,
`xlabel`, `ylabel`, `title`, `grid`, `legend`) is a permissive no-op,
since their exact call arguments are not part of this file's documented
external contract.

### Tests added (`tests/test_plot_edm.py`, new file)

- `test_plot_minuit_continuous_produces_output_file_for_log_with_trace_lines` -
  a small synthetic log with four matching `VariableMetricBuilder ... -
  FCN = ... Edm = ... NCalls` lines (including two with internal
  iteration `0`, to exercise the star-index branch); asserts the output
  file exists, is non-empty, and that `savefig` was called with exactly
  `(outname, {"bbox_inches": "tight"})`.
- `test_plot_minuit_continuous_produces_output_for_real_quickfit_log` -
  uses the real, already-committed
  `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/quickFitLog_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.log`
  fixture the plan calls out explicitly; asserts a non-empty output file
  is produced from genuine production log data, not just a synthetic one.
- `test_plot_minuit_continuous_no_output_when_no_matching_lines` - a log
  with no matching trace lines; asserts no exception, no output file
  created, `savefig` never called, and `"No matching data found."`
  actually printed (not just "does not raise").
- `test_plot_minuit_continuous_exits_with_status_1_for_missing_file` - a
  nonexistent input path; asserts `SystemExit` with `.code == 1`,
  `savefig` never called, and `"Error: The file was not found."` actually
  printed.

The regex-parsed values used in the synthetic-log test (`cumulative_x`,
`edm_values`, `star_indices`) were verified directly in a Python shell
against the real `pattern.search(...)` regex before being relied on in
the fixture, rather than hand-derived (the lesson already learned the
hard way in Chunk 5.A).

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git status --short` shows only
`tests/test_plot_edm.py` as untracked (new); `plot_edm.py` itself is
absent from `git diff --stat` because it was never touched. The new test
file is **not yet** registered in `scripts/quality_check.py` - per the
plan, that happens in Step B alongside `plot_edm.py` itself.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_edm.py -v` → 4 passed, run against
  the unmodified `plot_edm.py`.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 158 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (23 files unchanged) - unaffected,
  confirming the new file doesn't touch anything already gated.
- `python -m ruff check tests/test_plot_edm.py` /
  `python -m black --check tests/test_plot_edm.py` → both clean already
  (run ahead of Step B's registration, so the file starts clean).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' tests/test_plot_edm.py` → no output.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization checklist)

1. Chunk 9, Step A.
2. `plot_edm.py` untouched; only `tests/test_plot_edm.py` (new, untracked)
   added.
3. Every new test asserts real, specific behavior (exact `savefig` call
   arguments, exact printed messages, exact exit code) - not merely "does
   not raise."
4. Tests were run against the unmodified target file before any
   production change; results reported in full above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 9.B (extraction of `parse_minuit_edm_log`/`plot_minuit_edm_trace`)
and Chunks 10 through 12 are open.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 9.B: extract `parse_minuit_edm_log`/`plot_minuit_edm_trace`

### Objective

Split `plot_minuit_continuous()`, characterized in Chunk 9.A (commit
`de11262`), into `parse_minuit_edm_log()` (log parsing) and
`plot_minuit_edm_trace()` (matplotlib rendering), per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 9 - separating pure, trivially
unit-testable logic from rendering that needs matplotlib.

### What changed

- `plot_edm.py`:
  - `parse_minuit_edm_log(filename)` (new) - the regex-parsing loop,
    moved verbatim, returning `(cumulative_x, edm_values, star_indices)`.
    **Decision required by the plan and recorded here** (to be folded
    into `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` at Chunk 12): the original function caught
    `FileNotFoundError` itself and called `sys.exit(1)`; this function
    instead lets `FileNotFoundError` propagate naturally from `open(...)`
    - a pure, directly-callable function should not terminate the whole
    process, and doing so made it awkward to test (every caller would
    need `pytest.raises(SystemExit)` instead of a plain, specific
    exception type). `plot_minuit_continuous()` (below) is the thin
    CLI-facing wrapper that still does the print + `sys.exit(1)`,
    preserving the exact external behavior Chunk 9.A characterized.
  - `plot_minuit_edm_trace(cumulative_x, edm_values, star_indices,
    outname)` (new) - the rendering code, moved verbatim, including the
    "No matching data found." early return (moved here per the plan's own
    target-decomposition table) and every commented-out dead line
    (`#    plt.xscale('log')`, the three commented `#print(...)`
    diagnostics, etc.), preserved exactly.
  - `plot_minuit_continuous(filename, outname)` - now a thin orchestrator:
    calls `parse_minuit_edm_log()`, catching `FileNotFoundError` to
    reproduce the original print + `sys.exit(1)`, then calls
    `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`. Signature unchanged, per the plan.
  - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` deferred inside
    `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`, **placed after the empty-data early
    return**, not before it - a placement choice beyond what Chunk 9.A's
    entry committed to: it means the "no matching data" path through
    `plot_minuit_edm_trace()` (and, transitively, through
    `plot_minuit_continuous()`) needs **zero** matplotlib stubbing, not
    just `parse_minuit_edm_log()`. Confirmed directly: `import plot_edm`
    and calling `plot_edm.plot_minuit_edm_trace([], [], [], path)` both
    succeed with no `sys.modules` stubbing at all, verified before
    committing.
  - `import matplotlib.cm as cm` and `import numpy as np` removed - both
    confirmed dead in Chunk 9.A's entry (zero live uses), and this is the
    first time the file is lint-checked.
  - One `E501` fix: the regex pattern literal wrapped across two raw
    string literals (verified byte-identical `.pattern` before applying).
  - `python -m black plot_edm.py`: one further, first-ever reformat pass
    (quote style, argument wrapping) - matching every other
    newly-registered file in this plan.
- `tests/test_plot_edm.py`: rewritten - the module-loading helper that
  stubbed `matplotlib`/`numpy` in `sys.modules` before `exec_module`-ing
  the file is **gone entirely**, replaced with a plain `import plot_edm`
  at the top of the file - the concrete testability payoff the plan
  promised for this decomposition. Only the two tests that actually reach
  `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`'s non-empty-data path still stub
  `matplotlib`/`matplotlib.pyplot` (via a smaller, module-scoped
  `_stub_matplotlib()` helper, `matplotlib.cm` no longer stubbed since
  it's no longer imported); the other five tests - both empty-data paths,
  both `parse_minuit_edm_log()` failure/empty cases, and the
  missing-file/`SystemExit` case - now run with zero stubbing.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: registers `plot_edm.py` (in `python_targets`,
  at repository-root path, not under `python/`) and `tests/test_plot_edm.py`.

### Necessary test-relocation adaptation and new coverage (guardrail 4)

Chunk 9.A's four tests were adapted, not moved wholesale - the module-
loading mechanism itself changed (see above), and one test
(`test_plot_minuit_continuous_no_output_when_no_matching_lines`) dropped
its `matplotlib` stub entirely as a direct, intended consequence of the
import-placement decision. No assertion or expected value changed from
Chunk 9.A. Five new tests were added for the two newly-introduced
functions, per guardrail 4:
- `parse_minuit_edm_log()`: exact-tuple success case (reusing Chunk 9.A's
  already-verified synthetic-log values), empty-result case, and the
  `FileNotFoundError`-propagates case (the decision above).
- `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`: non-empty-data success case (asserts the
  exact `savefig` call, same as the orchestrator-level test) and the
  empty-data early-return case (asserts the message and that no file is
  created, with zero stubbing).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_edm.py -v` → 9 passed (4 adapted from
  Chunk 9.A plus 5 new).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 167 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (25 files unchanged).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- No integration-gate rerun: `plot_edm.py`'s output is a diagnostic plot,
  already outside the scientific-acceptance artifact contract per the
  2026-08-20 "Plotting separated from scientific acceptance" entry,
  matching the plan's own explicit acceptance-check note for this chunk.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction checklist)

1. Chunk 9, Step B (this entry) - the plan's first non-`run_anaFit.py`
   extraction.
2. Step A is committed (`de11262`) and referenced above.
3. No scientific constants, references, tolerances, dependency revisions,
   or canonical workflow arguments touched.
4. Relocated tests' diffs are not import-line-only - the module-loading
   mechanism itself changed (real `import plot_edm` instead of
   `exec_module`-with-stubbing), and one test's stub was dropped entirely
   as a direct, documented consequence of the import-placement decision;
   no assertion or expected value changed from Chunk 9.A.
5. Both new functions are covered: `parse_minuit_edm_log()` (3 tests:
   success, empty, failure) and `plot_minuit_edm_trace()` (2 tests:
   success, empty).
6. Confirmed by grep: `plot_edm.py`'s `plot_minuit_continuous()` calls
   both new functions and defines nothing else duplicating their logic.
7. Only this chunk's three changed files were staged.
8. All required Section 7 gates ran; the integration gate's inapplicability
   to this chunk is explicit in the plan itself, not a judgment call made
   here.
9. `git diff --check` passed.
10. This activity-log entry appended (not a rewrite of any existing
    section).
11. Chunks 10 through 12 remain open, listed below.
12. No other branch's Tier 3 work was consulted.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunks 10 through 12 in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are open.

## 2026-09-03: Correction — Chunk 9.B entry miscounted matplotlib-stubbing tests (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### What Copilot found

The Chunk 9.B entry above (`tests/test_plot_edm.py` bullet) says "the
two tests that actually reach `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`'s non-empty-data
path still stub `matplotlib`/`matplotlib.pyplot` ... the other five tests
... now run with zero stubbing." Checked directly against
`tests/test_plot_edm.py` as committed: `_stub_matplotlib(monkeypatch)` is
called by **three** tests
(`test_plot_minuit_edm_trace_produces_output_file_for_non_empty_data`,
`test_plot_minuit_continuous_produces_output_file_for_log_with_trace_lines`,
`test_plot_minuit_continuous_produces_output_for_real_quickfit_log`), not
two - confirmed by grepping the test file for the call site (three
matches). The remaining **six** tests (not five) run with zero stubbing.
Three plus six correctly sums to the file's actual nine tests; two plus
five does not (seven), which is itself a smaller internal inconsistency
in the original entry, also caught by this same review comment.

### Correction

The counts should read: **three** tests stub matplotlib (the two
`plot_minuit_continuous(...)` tests that reach real trace data, plus
`test_plot_minuit_edm_trace_produces_output_file_for_non_empty_data`
directly), and the other **six** tests - both `plot_minuit_edm_trace()`/
`plot_minuit_continuous()` empty-data paths, all three
`parse_minuit_edm_log()` cases (success, empty, missing-file), and the
`plot_minuit_continuous()` missing-file/`SystemExit` case - run with zero
stubbing.

This is a correction to prose in the Chunk 9.B entry's own description of
already-committed, unchanged test code - no test or production file was
touched to produce this finding or this correction. Per the activity
log's append-only guardrail, the original entry is left exactly as
written above; this section is the correction of record.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 10.A: characterization tests for `python/plotPostFit.py`

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `python/plotPostFit.py`
before splitting it into functions, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 10. The file has zero functions today — the entire 79-line file is
top-level script code (`import ROOT` at module scope, then a linear
sequence of `argparse`/`ROOT.TFile`/`TCanvas` calls) — so, per Chunk 10's
own instruction, Step A's characterization runs the current script
**end-to-end as a subprocess**, since there is nothing importable to call
directly yet.

### A discrepancy between the plan and this dev environment, found before writing the test

`plotPostFit.py` does `import ROOT` at module scope. Confirmed directly:
`.venv/bin/python -c "import ROOT"` raises `ModuleNotFoundError` in this
repository's dev venv — the same situation already documented for
`plot_edm.py` in the Chunk 9.A entry above, except here it cannot be
worked around with `sys.modules` stubbing, because Step A's own
characterization strategy (per the plan) is to run the *whole script* as
a subprocess against a real ROOT file and assert on its real output — the
point is to exercise genuine `ROOT.TFile`/`TCanvas`/`TPad` behavior, not a
stand-in for it. `plotPostFit.py` is only ever invoked in production
after `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` has been sourced (see
`scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`/`run_anaFit_J50.sh`, both of which run
`python "$repo_dir/python/plotPostFit.py" -i ... -o ...` after sourcing
that script), which puts the LCG/CVMFS-provided `python` (with `ROOT`
importable) on `PATH` — not this repository's own pytest dev venv. The
new test therefore sources `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` itself inside a
`subprocess.run(["bash", "-lc", ...])` call before invoking the script,
mirroring the exact probe pattern already established by
`test_analysis_workflows_integration.py::test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime`.
Run directly against this host's actual CVMFS/LCG environment, it passes
for real — this is not a mocked assertion.

### Target script (as it exists today)

| Entry point | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `python plotPostFit.py -i <inputFile> -o <output>` (whole script, no functions) | `-i/--inputFile: str` (a `PostFit_*.root` file), `-o/--output: str` | none (process exit code only) | opens `inputFile` via `ROOT.TFile.Open`; reads `Run3TLA/postfit`, `Run3TLA/data`, `Run3TLA/chi2`; builds a two-pad `TCanvas` (postfit-vs-data overlay + data/postfit ratio); writes `output` via `TCanvas.SaveAs`; closes `inputFile` |

### Tests added (`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`, new file)

- `test_plot_post_fit_script_produces_nonempty_pdf_for_real_fixture` —
  runs the real, unmodified script as a subprocess (via the
  `setup_buildAndFit.sh`-sourcing probe described above) against the
  already-committed
  `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
  fixture, writing to a `tmp_path` output; asserts the process exits `0`
  and the output PDF exists and is non-empty.

Per the plan's own instruction, **byte-identical PDF comparison is
deliberately not attempted**: ROOT's PDF output is not guaranteed
bit-reproducible across environments/fonts, and Tier 1 already
established (2026-08-20 activity-log entry, "Plotting separated from
scientific acceptance") that PDF artifacts are excluded from strict
scientific comparison. "Runs successfully against a real fixture and
produces a real, non-empty plot" is the chosen, and only, characterized
invariant — recorded here explicitly so a future reader does not expect
stronger guarantees than this step provides.

### A marker decision, recorded so Step B doesn't have to re-derive it

The new test is marked `@pytest.mark.requires_root` only (not also
`requires_analysis_dependencies`). Per `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s own marker
definitions, `requires_root` means "needs the configured ROOT/RooFit
runtime" and `requires_analysis_dependencies` means "needs prepared
external checkouts" (built `XMLReader`/`quickFit`/`pyBumpHunter`
binaries). `plotPostFit.py` needs only a working ROOT/RooFit runtime
(via `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`) — it never invokes `XMLReader`,
`quickFit`, or BumpHunter. `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` states the ordinary gate
("`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`") excludes only
`requires_analysis_dependencies`-marked tests, not `requires_root`-marked
ones — so, once Step B registers this file in `scripts/quality_check.py`,
this test is expected to actually run (and pass) as part of the ordinary
full gate on a host with the scientific runtime configured, exactly like
every other already-registered test file in this plan. This matches the
project's existing baseline assumption (`scripts/quality_check.py`'s own
`REQUIRED_BASELINE_PATHS`/`_print_optional_workflow_hints` checks) that
the J100/J50 scientific environment is present, not an optional extra.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git status --short` shows only
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` as untracked (new); `git diff --stat` is
empty — `python/plotPostFit.py` itself was never touched. The new test
file is **not yet** registered in `scripts/quality_check.py` — per the
plan, that happens in Step B alongside `python/plotPostFit.py` itself.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py -v` → 1 passed (run for
  real against this host's actual CVMFS/LCG scientific runtime, in
  13.81s).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 167 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (25 files unchanged) — unaffected,
  confirming the new file doesn't touch anything already gated.
- `python -m ruff check tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` /
  `python -m black --check tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` → both clean
  already (run ahead of Step B's registration, so the file starts clean).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `git diff --stat` → empty (no production file touched).
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` → no output.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

1. Chunk 10, Step A.
2. `python/plotPostFit.py` untouched; only `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`
   (new, untracked) added.
3. The new test asserts real, specific behavior (real process exit code,
   real non-empty PDF file on disk from a real ROOT fixture) — not merely
   "does not raise."
4. The test was run against the unmodified target file, for real, against
   this host's actual scientific runtime, before any production change;
   the exact result (1 passed, 13.81s) is reported above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 10.B (extraction of `parse_args`/`load_postfit_histograms`/
`build_ratio_histogram`/`draw_postfit_canvas`/`main`) and Chunks 11
through 12 are open.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 10.B: extract functions from `python/plotPostFit.py`

### Objective

Move `python/plotPostFit.py`'s top-level script code, characterized and
human-verified in Step A (commit `d24d5bf`), into five functions plus a
`main()` and an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 10.

### What changed

- `python/plotPostFit.py` restructured in place into:
  - `PostfitHistograms` — a `typing.NamedTuple` of `(postfit, data, chi2)`.
  - `parse_args(argv=None)` — the two `argparse` arguments, moved verbatim
    into a function, `parser.parse_args(argv)` instead of
    `parser.parse_args()` so it is callable with an explicit argument list
    in tests, matching the pattern already used for `run_cli.py`'s
    `build_arg_parser()`.
  - `load_postfit_histograms(input_file)` — opens `input_file`, reads
    `Run3TLA/postfit`/`Run3TLA/data`/`Run3TLA/chi2`, applies the same
    marker/line styling the original script applied inline, moved
    verbatim.
  - `build_ratio_histogram(data, postfit)` — the `h_ratio = data.Clone(...);
    h_ratio.Divide(postfit)` block and all of its styling calls, moved
    verbatim.
  - `draw_postfit_canvas(data, postfit, chi2_hist, ratio_hist)` — the
    two-pad canvas, legend, and χ²/ndof text block, moved verbatim (one
    string-formatting rewrite, see below); returns the built `TCanvas`
    without saving it.
  - `main(argv=None)` — orchestrates the above: sets
    `ROOT.gStyle.SetOptStat(0)`/`ROOT.gROOT.SetBatch(True)` (moved out of
    module scope, see decision below), calls `parse_args`, then
    `load_postfit_histograms`, `build_ratio_histogram`,
    `draw_postfit_canvas` in order, then `canvas.SaveAs(args.output)` and
    `postfit_file.Close()`.
  - `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` guard.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: `python/plotPostFit.py` and
  `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` added to `python_targets`/`test_targets`
  (alphabetically, next to `python/analysis_reference.py` and
  `tests/test_plot_edm.py` respectively).
- Step A's end-to-end test
  (`test_plot_post_fit_script_produces_nonempty_pdf_for_real_fixture`)
  kept, unchanged, in `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` — it is now a
  regression test of `main()`'s CLI contract, still valuable (the Test
  Relocation Rule does not apply here: this test never imported the
  production file, it always ran it as a subprocess, so there is no
  import line to update and nothing else to change).
- Five new tests added for the newly-introduced functions (listed below).

### A real, verified bug the plan's own table would have introduced: ROOT file lifetime

The plan's Section 6 target-decomposition table lists
`load_postfit_histograms(input_file)`'s output as just the
`PostfitHistograms` triple. Implemented and tested literally as written
first, then verified directly against the real fixture file, in this
host's actual scientific runtime (not simulated): once the function
returns and its own local `TFile` reference goes out of scope with no
other reference held, calling `.GetEntries()`/any other method on the
returned histograms fails with `AttributeError: 'CPyCppyy_NoneType'
object has no attribute 'GetEntries'` — the file is garbage-collected
before the histograms are used, invalidating them. The original,
single-scope script never hit this, because its `postfit_file` stayed
alive as a script-level name for the entire run; splitting it into a
function that returns only the histograms introduces a new object-
lifetime hazard that did not exist before. **Corrected the plan's
literal table**: `load_postfit_histograms()` returns
`(PostfitHistograms, postfit_file)` — the still-open `TFile` alongside
the triple — and `main()` holds that reference until after
`canvas.SaveAs(...)`, then calls `postfit_file.Close()`, exactly
mirroring the original script's object lifetime. This was verified two
ways: (1) a standalone reproduction script matching the plan's literal
signature, run for real, reproducing the crash; (2) the new
`test_load_postfit_histograms_applies_styling_and_keeps_file_open` test
below, confirmed to fail against the literal (unfixed) version — reverted
locally, observed a real `ValueError: too many values to unpack` at the
unpacking call site once `main()`'s own call was also downgraded to match
— and to pass against the fixed version once restored.

### A second decision, recorded per the plan's own instruction

The plan's table asks Step B to "decide whether styling stays in
[`load_postfit_histograms`] or moves to a separate
`style_postfit_histograms()`, and record the decision." Decision: styling
(`data`/`postfit`'s marker/line style) **stays inside**
`load_postfit_histograms()`. It is applied immediately and unconditionally
to every histogram this function loads, with no call site needing the
unstyled objects first — unlike `run_templates.py`'s Chunk 5 decomposition
(`_stage_xml_templates`/`_seed_prefit_parameters`), where splitting served
a real, independent testability or reuse need, a separate
`style_postfit_histograms()` here would only relocate four `Set*()` calls
without changing what is tested or reused.

### A third, related decision: where `ROOT.gStyle.SetOptStat(0)`/`ROOT.gROOT.SetBatch(True)` now live

The original script executed these two calls at **import time**, before
`argparse` even ran. The plan's decomposition table has no dedicated
"setup" function for them, and logically they belong wherever `main()`'s
orchestration begins — moved to the top of `main()`, called before
`parse_args()`, preserving the exact original ordering relative to
everything else. For the one real production call path (`python
plotPostFit.py -i ... -o ...`, which always reaches `main()` via the
`if __name__ == "__main__":` guard), behavior is unchanged bit-for-bit.
The only behavioral difference is for a hypothetical bare `import
plotPostFit` with `main()` never called — which nothing in this
repository does (confirmed by `grep -rn "plotPostFit"` across the whole
repository: only the two shell launchers invoke it, both as a
subprocess). This is also a direct, verified testability payoff:
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`'s `parse_args()` tests import the module
with a bare, attribute-less `ROOT` stub (nothing beyond the module name
needs to resolve) precisely because no ROOT attribute is touched at
import time any more.

### A verified byte-identical string-formatting rewrite

`draw_postfit_canvas()`'s χ²/ndof text was built with implicit
concatenation (`string = "#chi^{2}/ndof = "; string += f"{rchi2:.3f}"`);
rewritten as a single f-string,
`f"#chi^{{2}}/ndof = {rchi2:.3f}"`. Verified byte-identical in a live
Python shell for a representative value (`rchi2 = 12.34567`) before
relying on it — both forms produce `'#chi^{2}/ndof = 12.346'`.

### New tests added (`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`)

- `test_parse_args_parses_required_flags`,
  `test_parse_args_accepts_long_flags`,
  `test_parse_args_requires_both_flags` (parametrized: no args, only
  `-i`, only `-o`) — zero real ROOT: `parse_args()` never touches it, so
  these import the module with a bare, attribute-less `ROOT` stub in
  `sys.modules` (mirroring `test_run_anaFit.py`'s established stubbing
  style) and call `parse_args()` directly.
- `test_load_postfit_histograms_applies_styling_and_keeps_file_open` —
  real ROOT, run as a subprocess snippet (after sourcing
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`, mirroring
  `test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime`'s probe
  pattern) against the same real fixture Step A used; asserts every
  styling call's exact effect (marker style/size/color, line
  width/color) and that the returned `postfit_file` is still open with
  usable histograms — the direct regression test for the file-lifetime
  fix above.
- `test_build_ratio_histogram_computes_real_ratio_and_styling` — per the
  plan's own instruction, uses small real `ROOT.TH1D` objects built
  in-test (no input file needed); asserts the actual computed ratio bin
  contents (`10/5=2.0`, `20/40=0.5`) and every styling call's exact
  effect, not just "was called."
- `test_draw_postfit_canvas_returns_two_pad_canvas` — small real
  `ROOT.TH1D`/`build_ratio_histogram()` output; asserts the returned
  object `isinstance(..., ROOT.TCanvas)` and that its primitives include
  pads named exactly `pad1`/`pad2`.

All four new real-ROOT assertions (styling values, ratio bin contents,
axis titles/divisions, marker style, pad names) were independently
verified in a live, real-ROOT shell against this host's actual scientific
runtime before being relied on in the tests, rather than hand-derived.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`plotPostFit.py` produces plots, not scientific acceptance results — it
is excluded from the frozen `analysis_reference.json` contract (Tier 1,
"Plotting separated from scientific acceptance"). Every ROOT call, in the
same order, with the same arguments, was moved verbatim into its new
function (the two deviations above — the returned `TFile` handle and the
`gStyle`/`gROOT` call site — are both non-scientific, plot-only
concerns, not fit/statistics logic, and both were verified empirically
to reproduce the exact original end-to-end output: a real, non-empty
PDF from the real J100 fixture, `python
plotPostFit.py -i run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root
-o <tmp>` → exit 0, `<tmp>` created and non-empty, run directly against
this host's real scientific runtime after this commit's change, not
just via the test suite).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py -v` → 9 passed (46.87s),
  run for real against this host's actual CVMFS/LCG scientific runtime.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 176 passed, 2
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (27 files unchanged).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` → 1 passed, 2 deselected, in
  145.24s (run in the background per this session's established practice
  for this specific command, which regularly exceeds the foreground tool
  timeout; this chunk is not one of Section 7's chunks where this gate is
  strictly mandatory, but it is rerun here anyway as an extra safety net,
  since this chunk changed real ROOT object-lifetime control flow — it
  confirms the J100/J50 authoritative workflows, which both invoke
  `plotPostFit.py`, still match the frozen scientific reference).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' python/plotPostFit.py tests/test_plot_post_fit.py scripts/quality_check.py` →
  no output.
- `grep -n "plotPostFit" scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh` →
  both launchers' invocations (`python "$repo_dir/python/plotPostFit.py"
  -i ... -o ...`) unchanged, confirming the public CLI contract this
  refactor must not break.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)

1. Step A's commit (`d24d5bf`) is named above; this commit's Step A test
   is kept unchanged, and five new tests are added for the newly-
   introduced functions — none of the five are relocated, all are new.
2. `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`'s Step A test required no diff beyond
   its position in the file (no import line existed to change, since it
   was always subprocess-based).
3. Production code (the two shell launchers) is unchanged and still
   calls the script's unchanged public CLI contract — confirmed by grep,
   not assumed.
4. `python/plotPostFit.py` does not import from `run_anaFit.py` or any
   of the seven extracted `run_anaFit.py` modules — it was never part of
   that module system; it is its own standalone script under `python/`.
5. Required Section 7 gates ran; output captured above.
6. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 11 (`plot_postfit.cpp`) and Chunk 12
(`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`) are open.

## 2026-09-03: Fix plot_post_fit real-ROOT tests failing in CI (no CVMFS mount)

### Objective

The GitHub Actions CI run for this branch (`ubuntu`-hosted runner,
`/home/runner/work/FrequentistFramework/FrequentistFramework`) reported
`quality_check.py --mode full` failing with 4 real failures in
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`:
`test_load_postfit_histograms_applies_styling_and_keeps_file_open`,
`test_build_ratio_histogram_computes_real_ratio_and_styling`,
`test_draw_postfit_canvas_returns_two_pad_canvas`, and
`test_plot_post_fit_script_produces_nonempty_pdf_for_real_fixture` — each
failing with `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh: line 12:
/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh: No
such file or directory`. This is a genuine, verified environment gap, not
a false report: the GitHub Actions runner has no CVMFS mount at all, so
any test that actually sources `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` cannot pass
there, regardless of ROOT/RooFit correctness.

### The actual bug: an incorrect marker decision in Chunk 10.A/10.B

Chunk 10.A's activity-log entry recorded a marker decision: mark these
tests `@pytest.mark.requires_root` only, reasoning from
`doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s literal marker definitions ("`requires_root`:
needs the configured ROOT/RooFit runtime", "`requires_analysis_dependencies`:
needs prepared external checkouts") that a test needing only ROOT (not
built `XMLReader`/`quickFit`/`pyBumpHunter` binaries) should not need the
second marker. **This reasoning was wrong in practice**: it did not
account for `test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime` (in
`tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`) already being marked
**both** `@pytest.mark.requires_root` and
`@pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies`, despite doing exactly the
same thing these four new tests do - sourcing
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` in a subprocess. That existing precedent
should have been followed literally instead of re-derived abstractly from
the marker-name definitions. The real, load-bearing distinction is not
"does it need XMLReader/quickFit/pyBumpHunter" but "does it need CVMFS
mounted at all" - and every test that sources
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` needs CVMFS, full stop.

This bug only surfaced in CI, not in this developer's own session, because
this session's environment (`afs.cern.ch`, with CVMFS mounted) satisfies
both markers' conditions simultaneously - `requires_root` alone was
sufficient there to reach a real, working ROOT runtime, masking the
missing `requires_analysis_dependencies` marker's actual purpose (keeping
the test out of the *ordinary*, CVMFS-less CI gate in the first place).

### Fix

Added `@pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies` alongside the
existing `@pytest.mark.requires_root` on all four real-ROOT tests in
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` (the three added in Chunk 10.B, plus the
end-to-end test carried over unchanged from Chunk 10.A/Step A). No test
body, fixture, or assertion changed - only the marker decorators. This
matches `test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime`'s own
markers exactly, and restores `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s stated contract:
"the ordinary gate excludes tests marked `requires_analysis_dependencies`
and does not include the integration test file."

`test_parse_args_*` (5 tests) are unaffected - they never touch ROOT or
CVMFS and continue to run in the ordinary gate, exactly as they did in
CI's own run (`.....FFFF` in the CI log: 5 passes, then the 4 real-ROOT
failures, confirming the split was already correct for those five).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py -v` (no marker filter,
  matching Chunk 10's own acceptance check, run for real against this
  host's actual CVMFS/LCG scientific runtime) → 9 passed (46.38s) -
  unaffected by the marker-only change.
- `python -m pytest -m "not requires_analysis_dependencies"
  tests/test_plot_post_fit.py -v` (reproducing `quality_check.py`'s own
  filter, matching what CI actually runs) → 5 passed, 4 deselected - the
  four CVMFS-dependent tests are now correctly excluded from exactly the
  gate that failed in CI.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 172 passed, 6
  deselected (2 pre-existing + these 4, newly and correctly excluded);
  ruff clean; black clean (27 files unchanged).
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` → no output.

### What this commit does NOT do

Does not touch `python/plotPostFit.py` (production code) at all - this is
a test-marker-only fix. Per the append-only guardrail, Chunk 10.A's and
10.B's entries above are left exactly as written, including 10.A's now-
superseded "marker decision" reasoning and 10.B's verification section
(which reported results from this developer's own CVMFS-mounted session,
still accurate for that environment) - this section is the correction of
record for what CI itself actually needs.

## 2026-09-03: Fix plotPostFit.py's module-level ROOT coupling and a real legend-lifetime bug (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### Finding 1: `parse_args()` still needed ROOT to import

Copilot: "The extracted `parse_args()` API is still impossible to import
in the repository's ROOT-less Python environment because ROOT is
imported unconditionally here. This also conflicts with Chunk 10's
explicit requirement that `parse_args()` be tested with zero stubbing;
the new tests only pass by injecting a fake ROOT module. Please defer
ROOT imports to the ROOT-dependent functions."

Verified: correct. `python/plotPostFit.py` had `import ROOT` at module
scope (left there after Chunk 10.B's own decision to move
`ROOT.gStyle`/`ROOT.gROOT.SetBatch()` into `main()`, without going the
rest of the way and deferring the bare `import ROOT` statement itself).
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s own Chunk 10 text states `parse_args()`
"needs no ROOT at all and should be tested with zero stubbing" -
Chunk 10.B's tests instead stubbed `sys.modules["ROOT"]` with a bare
`ModuleType`, satisfying the letter of "the module imports" but not
"zero stubbing."

Fix: removed the module-level `import ROOT` entirely. `import ROOT` is
now deferred inside each function that actually touches it -
`load_postfit_histograms()`, `draw_postfit_canvas()`, `main()` - matching
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Section 4.2's deferred-import rule already
applied to every other ROOT-touching function across this whole Tier 3
plan (this file was simply not brought fully into line with it in Chunk
10.B). `build_ratio_histogram()` needed no `ROOT` import at all, even
before this fix - it only calls methods on the histogram objects passed
to it. `PostfitHistograms`'s field type hints (`"ROOT.TH1"`) are string
literals, never evaluated at runtime, so they impose no import
requirement; a `if TYPE_CHECKING: import ROOT` guard was added so
`ruff`'s `F821` (undefined name in a string annotation) stays satisfied
without a real runtime import.

`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` updated to match: the
`_import_plot_post_fit_with_stubbed_root()` helper is gone; the module is
now imported once, plainly, at the top of the test file
(`from python import plotPostFit as plot_post_fit`), exactly like
`test_run_manifest.py`/`test_run_execution.py` already do for their own
ROOT-free modules. The three `parse_args()` tests no longer take a
`monkeypatch` fixture at all.

Verified directly, twice: (1) `python -c "import sys;
sys.path.insert(0, 'python'); import plotPostFit as ppf;
ppf.parse_args(['-i','a','-o','b']); print('ROOT' in sys.modules)"` →
prints `False` - the module imports and `parse_args()` runs with zero
ROOT presence in `sys.modules`, real or fake. (2) the full test file
still passes for real against this host's actual ROOT runtime for the
other four tests, which still need it.

### Finding 2: the canvas-content test was too weak - and while fixing it, a real bug was found

Copilot: "This test only verifies that two named pads exist, so it still
passes if the refactor drops the data/postfit plots, ratio, legend, or
chi2 annotation - the actual behavior of `draw_postfit_canvas()`. The
end-to-end test's non-empty-PDF check would also pass for an effectively
empty canvas. Please assert the expected primitives/content in each pad."

Verified, and this surfaced something worse than a coverage gap: while
building a stronger test, `draw_postfit_canvas()`'s legend was found to
be **actually missing** from its own output, right now, in the code
already committed for Chunk 10.B - a real regression Copilot's coverage
concern would have caught, had the stronger test existed from the start.

Reproduced directly, isolated from the rest of the function: `legend =
ROOT.TLegend(...); legend.AddEntry(...); legend.Draw()` inside a
function, with `legend` never referenced again after that function
returns, produces a `TCanvas` whose pad contains **no `TLegend` at all**
- `[p.ClassName() for p in pad1.GetListOfPrimitives()]` came back
`['TH1D', 'TH1D']` with no `TLegend` present. Cause: cppyy (PyROOT) owns,
and therefore deletes, the underlying C++ object of any `TObject` it
constructed once the Python wrapper's reference count reaches zero -
`legend` was a purely local variable inside `draw_postfit_canvas()` with
no reference surviving the function's return, so it was garbage-collected
before the caller ever saw the canvas. This is the exact same class of
hazard already found and fixed for `load_postfit_histograms()`'s `TFile`
in Chunk 10.B (see that entry above), now found a second time for a
different object - both hazards exist only because the original,
single-scope script kept every such object alive as a script-level name
for its entire run, a guarantee that silently broke the moment the code
was split into functions with their own local scopes.

Fix: `ROOT.SetOwnership(legend, False)` immediately after constructing
the legend, telling cppyy the C++ side now owns it, so it survives after
the Python reference is gone. Verified directly: with the fix reverted
locally, `[p.ClassName() for p in pad1.GetListOfPrimitives()]` came back
without `TLegend`; with it restored, `['TH1D', 'TH1D', 'TLegend', ...]`.
The end-to-end script's output PDF also grew from 170489 to 170679 bytes
once the legend was actually being drawn again - independent, physical
corroboration.

`draw_postfit_canvas()`'s test
(`test_draw_postfit_canvas_returns_two_pad_canvas`, renamed
`test_draw_postfit_canvas_draws_expected_content_in_each_pad`) rewritten
to assert real content per pad, not just pad names: pad1's two `TH1D`
histograms by name (`data`/`postfit`), exactly one `TLegend` with exactly
the two expected `(label, option)` entries (`("Data", "lep")`,
`("Postfit", "l")`), a `TLatex` whose exact title is the rendered
`#chi^{2}/ndof = ...` string; pad2's single `TH1D` by name (the ratio
histogram's own name). This test was confirmed to **fail** with
`AssertionError: legend missing or duplicated in pad1` against the
`ROOT.SetOwnership(...)`-reverted code, and to pass against the fix -
the direct regression test for this bug, exactly the protection Copilot
asked for.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py -v` → 9 passed (~50-67s
  across repeated runs), run for real against this host's actual
  CVMFS/LCG scientific runtime.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 172 passed, 6
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (27 files unchanged).
- `python "$repo_dir/python/plotPostFit.py" -i
  run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root -o
  <tmp>` (direct end-to-end invocation, matching the launchers exactly) →
  exit 0, `<tmp>` created, 170679 bytes.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` → 1 passed, 2 deselected, in
  165.61s (run in the background per this session's established
  practice) - confirms the J100/J50 authoritative workflows, which both
  invoke `plotPostFit.py`, still match the frozen scientific reference
  after both fixes.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' python/plotPostFit.py tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` →
  no output.

### What this commit does NOT do

Both fixes are confined to `python/plotPostFit.py` and
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`. No other file changed. Per the append-only
guardrail, Chunk 10.A's and 10.B's entries above are left exactly as
written - this section is the correction of record for both Copilot
findings.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 11.A: characterization test for `plot_postfit.cpp`

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `plot_postfit.cpp`
(repository root) before splitting it into `read_bumphunter_results()`,
`load_postfit_histograms()`, `draw_residual_panel()`, and a slimmed
`plot_postfit()` orchestrator, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk
11. The file has one function today, `plot_postfit(char const * in_dir,
char const * pars_str)` - no existing function boundary to characterize
more precisely yet, and no test harness of any kind exists for ROOT
macros anywhere in this repository, so, per Chunk 11's own instruction,
Step A characterizes the **whole macro's current output**, run for real
as a subprocess.

### Target function (as it exists today)

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `void plot_postfit(char const * in_dir, char const * pars_str)` | `in_dir: char const *` (a fit output directory), `pars_str: char const *` (e.g. `"six"`) | `void` | opens up to four `TFile`s under `in_dir` (native/masked PostFit + FitParameters); `exit(1)` if the native residual/chi2 histograms are missing; optionally parses `<in_dir>/BHresults.json` via regex for BumpHunter results, falling back to `bump_hunter = false` when the file is absent; draws three residual panels (params, native, native-rebinned) to a canvas; writes `<in_dir>/post_fit.pdf` via `TCanvas::Print` |

### Test infrastructure decision

Per Chunk 11's own instruction: a small ROOT test macro invoked via
`root -l -b -q` from a `pytest` wrapper (`subprocess.run`), so it reports
through the same `pytest`-based gates as everything else rather than
inventing a second CI mechanism. `plot_postfit.cpp` needs a real ROOT
runtime this repository's own pytest dev venv does not have (confirmed
directly, same situation already documented for
`python/plotPostFit.py`'s ROOT dependency and
`tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`'s scientific-runtime
tests) - it is only ever invoked in production after
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` has been sourced (see
`scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`/`run_anaFit_J50.sh`, both of which run
`root -l -q "plot_postfit.cpp(\"$folder\", \"$pars\")"` after sourcing
that script). The new test sources that same setup script itself inside
a `subprocess.run(["bash", "-lc", ...])` call before invoking the macro,
mirroring the exact probe pattern already established by
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`'s own end-to-end test and
`test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime`.

Marked both `@pytest.mark.requires_root` and
`@pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies` from the start this time -
applying the lesson from the CI-failure fix earlier today (see that
entry above): any test that actually sources
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` needs CVMFS mounted, so it must carry both
markers to stay out of the CVMFS-less ordinary CI gate, regardless of
whether it also needs built `XMLReader`/`quickFit`/`pyBumpHunter`
binaries specifically.

### Test added (`tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`, new file)

- `test_plot_postfit_macro_produces_nonempty_pdf_for_real_fixture` - runs
  the real, unmodified macro as a subprocess (via the
  `setup_buildAndFit.sh`-sourcing probe described above) against a
  `tmp_path` **copy** of the already-committed
  `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/` fixture directory (never written
  into the tracked fixture itself - the macro writes `post_fit.pdf` into
  `in_dir`), with `pars_str = "six"`. This fixture directory has no
  `BHresults.json` and no `*_masked.root` files, confirmed by direct
  listing - exercising the current no-BumpHunter fallback path
  (`bump_hunter = false`) exactly as Chunk 11 specifies. Asserts the
  process exits `0` and `post_fit.pdf` exists and is non-empty in the
  copied directory.

Per the plan's own instruction (and Tier 1's existing "Plotting separated
from scientific acceptance" policy, already cited for
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`), **byte-identical PDF comparison is
deliberately not attempted** - "runs successfully against a real fixture
and produces a real, non-empty plot" is the chosen, and only,
characterized invariant. As independent, incidental corroboration (not a
relied-upon assertion): the macro's real output PDF came back exactly
41589 bytes in this session, byte-for-byte identical to the already-
committed `post_fit.pdf` sitting in the tracked fixture directory from an
earlier real production run of this exact, unmodified macro against this
exact fixture - consistent with, though not proof of, a fully
deterministic PDF for this specific ROOT/font/data combination.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file was modified. `git status --short` shows only
`tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` as untracked (new); `git diff --stat`
is empty - `plot_postfit.cpp` itself was never touched. Per Chunk 11's
own text, no `scripts/quality_check.py` registration applies to this
file (it only covers Python files) - `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`
is a Python test file and could in principle be registered, but Chunk 11
explicitly does not require it (unlike Chunks 9/10's Python production
targets), so registration is deferred to a decision recorded in Step B
below rather than assumed here.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py -v` → 1 passed
  (19.83s), run for real against this host's actual CVMFS/LCG scientific
  runtime.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 172 passed, 6
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (27 files unchanged) - unaffected,
  confirming the new file doesn't touch anything already gated.
- `python -m ruff check tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` /
  `python -m black --check tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` → both
  clean already.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` → no
  output.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

1. Chunk 11, Step A.
2. `plot_postfit.cpp` untouched; only
   `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` (new, untracked) added.
3. The new test asserts real, specific behavior (real process exit code,
   real non-empty PDF file on disk from a real ROOT fixture) - not merely
   "does not raise."
4. The test was run against the unmodified target file, for real, against
   this host's actual scientific runtime, before any production change;
   the exact result (1 passed, 19.83s) is reported above for review.
5. Human-verification checkpoint: presented to the user in session for
   confirmation before Step B's commit is made (recorded per Step B's own
   activity-log entry once given).

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 11.B (extraction of `read_bumphunter_results`/
`load_postfit_histograms`/`draw_residual_panel`) and Chunk 12 are open.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 11.B: extract functions from `plot_postfit.cpp`

### Objective

Move `plot_postfit.cpp`'s single 257-line function, characterized and
human-verified in Step A (commit `2b7d168`), into `read_bumphunter_results()`,
`load_postfit_histograms()`, `draw_residual_panel()`, plus a slimmed
`plot_postfit()` orchestrator with its public entry point's exact name and
parameter order unchanged, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 11.

### What changed

- `plot_postfit.cpp` restructured in place into:
  - `struct BumpHunterInfo { float global_pval, significance, mask_min,
    mask_max; bool available; }` and `BumpHunterInfo
    read_bumphunter_results(string const & bh_log_name)` - the log-reading/
    regex-parsing block moved verbatim, including its diagnostic prints
    (`cout << bh_log_name << endl;` and the "WARNING: Could not parse
    values..." message). `available` matches the original's
    `bump_hunter = false` fallback exactly: `false` only when the log file
    could not be opened, `true` otherwise - not an exception.
  - `struct PostfitHistograms` (the ten `TH1D*` fields, renamed without
    their `h_`/`_native`/`_masked` prefixes since they're now struct
    members: `native`, `native_rebinned`, `native_chi2`,
    `native_chi2_rebinned`, `masked`, `masked_rebinned`, `masked_chi2`,
    `masked_chi2_rebinned`, `native_params`, `masked_params`) and
    `PostfitHistograms load_postfit_histograms(TFile * native, TFile *
    masked, TFile * native_params, TFile * masked_params)` - the
    `Get<TH1D>` block moved verbatim, including the pre-existing
    behavior that `native_params`/`masked_params` are dereferenced
    unconditionally inside the `if (native)`/`if (masked)` guards, with
    no null check of their own (see "Preserved pre-existing landmine"
    below).
  - `enum class ResidualPanelKind { kParams, kNative, kNativeRebinned }`
    and `struct ResidualPanelInfo { ResidualPanelKind kind; float
    native_chi2_ndof, native_pval, masked_chi2_ndof, masked_pval; }` -
    **new**, not in the plan's literal table (see "A real gap in the
    plan's stated signature" below).
  - `void draw_residual_panel(TCanvas * can, TH1D * first, TH1D * second,
    bool bump_hunter, BumpHunterInfo const & bh, char const * pars_str,
    char const * out_file_name, ResidualPanelInfo const & info)` - the
    body of the original for-loop, moved verbatim, with every `h.first ==
    h_native_params`/`h.first == h_native`/`h.first == h_native_rebinned`
    pointer-identity check replaced by `info.kind ==
    ResidualPanelKind::k...`, and the scalar chi2/pval `Form(...)` calls
    reading from `info.native_chi2_ndof`/etc. instead of outer-scope
    variables.
  - `void plot_postfit(char const * in_dir, char const * pars_str)`
    (unchanged signature) - becomes the orchestrator: builds the six
    input/output paths (unchanged), opens the four `TFile`s (unchanged),
    calls `load_postfit_histograms()`, `read_bumphunter_results()`,
    computes `bump_hunter = plot_masked && bh_info.available` (see
    "Preserving `plot_masked`'s exact role" below), computes the ten
    chi2/pval/nbkg scalars (moved verbatim, now reading from the
    `PostfitHistograms` struct's fields instead of individually-named
    pointers), opens the canvas/PDF, then loops over the three panels
    (`{h.native_params, h.masked_params, kParams}`,
    `{h.native, h.masked, kNative}`, `{h.native_rebinned,
    h.masked_rebinned, kNativeRebinned}`) calling `draw_residual_panel()`
    once per pair, per the plan's own "the existing loop... calls this
    once per pair instead of repeating the body inline" instruction.
- `tests/root_macros/BHresults_sample.json` (**new, tracked fixture**) -
  a small, hand-written JSON with known values
  (`global_Pval: 0.1234, significance: 2.5, MaskMin: 500.0, MaskMax: 700.0`),
  since this repository's existing J100 canonical run has no
  `BHresults.json` (it is unmasked). The regex `read_bumphunter_results()`
  uses does a flat text scan, not real JSON-schema-aware parsing (verified
  directly against `python/FindBHWindow.py`, the actual producer of real
  `BHresults.json` files - its `global_Pval`/`significance` keys live
  nested inside a `pyBHresult` sub-object, not top-level; the regex finds
  them regardless of nesting depth), so a flat fixture exercises the exact
  same code path as a real, nested production file.
- `tests/root_macros/test_read_bumphunter_results.cpp` (**new**) - the
  first-ever ROOT-macro unit test in this repository, per Chunk 11's own
  instruction. `#include "../../plot_postfit.cpp"` to reach
  `BumpHunterInfo`/`read_bumphunter_results()` directly (a fresh `root -l
  -b -q` process per invocation, so no redefinition risk from including a
  `.cpp` without an include guard). Calls `read_bumphunter_results()`
  against the fixture above and asserts each `BumpHunterInfo` field
  against the fixture's known values (tolerance `1e-4f`, matching
  `stof`'s own float precision), then against `<fixture>.does_not_exist`
  and asserts `available == false` and all four scalar fields stay at
  their zero-initialized defaults. Prints `TEST_READ_BUMPHUNTER_RESULTS_OK`/
  `_FAILED` and exits `0`/`1` accordingly - explicit `if (!...) { cout <<
  "FAIL: ..."; ok = false; }` checks were used instead of `assert()`, to
  avoid depending on whether this ROOT build's Cling compiles with
  `NDEBUG` defined.
- `tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py` (**new**) - the thin
  Python/pytest wrapper invoking the macro above via `subprocess.run`,
  matching `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`'s own wrapper pattern
  exactly (same `setup_buildAndFit.sh`-sourcing probe, same two markers).
- `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`'s existing test kept unchanged - it
  is now an end-to-end regression test of the rewritten `plot_postfit()`,
  still valuable (per Chunk 11's own instruction to keep it, not delete
  it).
- No `scripts/quality_check.py` registration - it only covers Python
  files, and Chunk 11 doesn't require registering the two new Python test
  files either (unlike Chunks 9/10's Python production targets).

### A real gap in the plan's stated `draw_residual_panel()` signature

`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s Chunk 11 table gives
`draw_residual_panel()` exactly seven parameters: `(TCanvas* can, TH1D*
first, TH1D* second, bool bump_hunter, BumpHunterInfo const& bh, char
const* pars_str, char const* out_file_name)`. Implementing this literally
is impossible without losing real, observable behavior: the original
loop's panel-specific content - Y-axis range, draw option ("HIST" vs
plain), whether the zero-line and per-panel "range: ... GeV" text are
drawn, whether the "Bump Hunter" header and global p-val/significance/
mask-range text appear, and which of the four chi2/ndof-and-p-val text
boxes are shown - is driven by two things neither struct nor scalar
parameter in that seven-parameter list can express: (1) **which** of the
three panels this call is drawing (originally `h.first ==
h_native_params`/`h_native`/`h_native_rebinned` pointer-identity checks
against outer-scope variables `draw_residual_panel()` no longer has
access to), and (2) the four scalar chi2/ndof and p-value numbers each
panel displays (`native_chi2_ndof`, `native_pval`, `masked_chi2_ndof`,
`masked_pval`, each with a separately-computed "rebinned" variant used
only by the rebinned panel) - values the plan's own `PostfitHistograms`
struct doesn't carry either (they are computed in `plot_postfit()`
*after* `load_postfit_histograms()` returns, straight from
`GetBinContent()` calls).

Corrected: added `ResidualPanelKind` (an explicit tag replacing the
pointer-identity checks) and `ResidualPanelInfo` (bundling the tag with
the four scalar values relevant to whichever panel is being drawn) as an
eighth parameter. This is the smallest addition that preserves every
originally-observable difference between the three panels; verified
directly (see "Verification performed" below) that the rewritten macro,
run against the same fixture Step A characterized, produces a PDF
byte-identical to both Step A's own captured output and the already-
committed reference `post_fit.pdf` in the tracked fixture directory - not
just "runs and produces a plot", but the exact same plot.

### Preserving `plot_masked`'s exact role

The original set `bool bump_hunter{plot_masked};` (a file-scope `bool
const plot_masked{true}`), then only ever set it to `false` in the `else`
branch when the BumpHunter log could not be opened - meaning `bump_hunter`
equals `plot_masked` whenever the log **can** be opened, and `false`
otherwise. Since `read_bumphunter_results()`'s new signature takes only
`bh_log_name` (per the plan), it cannot see `plot_masked` itself.
`plot_postfit()` now computes `bump_hunter = plot_masked &&
bh_info.available;` - the exact logical equivalent (`available` is
`false` only when the file could not be opened, matching the original
`else` branch precisely; `plot_masked && true == plot_masked`, matching
the original `if` branch precisely), keeping `plot_masked` as a real,
still-honored toggle rather than silently dropping its effect.

### Preserved pre-existing landmine (guardrail 1: no fix, just documented)

`load_postfit_histograms()` dereferences `native_params->Get<TH1D>(...)`
unconditionally inside the `if (native)` block (and
`masked_params->Get<TH1D>(...)` inside `if (masked)`), with no null check
of `native_params`/`masked_params` themselves - if the native `PostFit_*`
file opens successfully but the corresponding `FitParameters_*` file does
not, this crashes on a null-pointer dereference. This is pre-existing
behavior in the original, unmodified `plot_postfit()` (confirmed by
re-reading the source before moving anything), not something this
refactor introduced or is asked to fix (guardrail: "no scope for fixing
pre-existing, unrelated issues noticed along the way") - moved verbatim,
landmine included, exactly as guardrail 6 requires for the `nPars`
double-match quirk found in Chunk 5.

### Dead-code cleanup

`bool is_rebinned{false};` (declared in the original loop, immediately
before the `for` loop it was presumably meant to help control) is never
read anywhere in the function - confirmed by `grep -n "is_rebinned"
plot_postfit.cpp` returning only its own declaration line. Dropped as
mechanical, zero-behavior-change cleanup, matching this project's
established practice (e.g. Chunk 8/9's dead-import removals) for a file
newly being reorganized.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`plot_postfit.cpp` produces plots, not scientific acceptance results - it
is excluded from the frozen `analysis_reference.json` contract (Tier 1,
"Plotting separated from scientific acceptance"), same as
`python/plotPostFit.py`. Every ROOT call, in the same order, with the
same arguments, was moved verbatim into its new function; the two
additions above (`ResidualPanelKind`/`ResidualPanelInfo`, and the
`plot_masked && bh_info.available` equivalence) are both non-scientific,
plot-only/control-flow concerns, verified empirically, not just argued:
run directly against a `tmp_path` copy of the real J100 fixture
(no `BHresults.json`, exercising the no-BumpHunter fallback path), the
rewritten macro exits `0` and produces `post_fit.pdf` at **exactly
41589 bytes** - byte-for-byte identical to both Step A's own captured
output and the already-committed `post_fit.pdf` sitting in the tracked
fixture directory from an earlier real production run of the original,
unmodified macro against this exact fixture. `guardrail 11` (no new
external library linked) confirmed by diffing the file's `#include` list
before and after: unchanged.

The `bump_hunter == true` (masked-fit) branch inside `draw_residual_panel()`
is **not** exercised by any automated test at this repository state - it
was not exercised by any automated test before this refactor either (no
masked fixture exists; the plan explicitly scopes synthetic ROOT-file-
construction fixtures for the masked path out of this chunk, see below),
so this refactor introduces no new risk there relative to what already
existed. As independent evidence that this branch is at least still
syntactically/type-correct: C++ does not skip compiling an `if` branch
that happens not to execute at runtime, so Cling's successful compilation
and 0-exit run of the whole macro (with `bump_hunter == false` this run)
already exercised compiling the `if (bump_hunter) { ... }` branch's code,
even though it did not execute it.

### Deliberate scope boundary (to be restated in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`, Chunk 12)

Per the plan's own instruction, `load_postfit_histograms()` is not given
its own dedicated unit test - it is "harder to test in isolation without
a real `TFile`", and inventing a synthetic ROOT-file-construction fixture
for it is explicitly out of this chunk's scope. It remains covered only by
`tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`'s existing end-to-end test. Likewise,
`draw_residual_panel()`'s `bump_hunter == true` path (see above) has no
dedicated test either - this is a slightly broader boundary than the plan
states explicitly for `load_postfit_histograms()` alone, but follows the
same underlying constraint (no masked/BumpHunter fixture exists in this
repository to exercise it against). Both are deliberate, explained scope
boundaries, not silent gaps - flagged here for Chunk 12 to restate in
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s "Known Limitations" section.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py
  tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py -v` → 2 passed (36.62s), run for
  real against this host's actual CVMFS/LCG scientific runtime - the
  exact acceptance-check command Chunk 11 specifies.
- Direct macro invocation (`root -l -b -q "plot_postfit.cpp(\"<tmp copy
  of the J100 fixture>\", \"six\")"`, matching the launchers exactly) →
  exit `0`, `post_fit.pdf` created at exactly 41589 bytes - byte-
  identical to Step A's own characterization run and to the already-
  committed reference PDF.
- Negative control for the new ROOT-macro unit test: re-ran
  `test_read_bumphunter_results.cpp` against a deliberately corrupted
  fixture copy (`global_Pval` changed from `0.1234` to `0.9999`) →
  `FAIL: global_pval = 0.9999, expected 0.1234`,
  `TEST_READ_BUMPHUNTER_RESULTS_FAILED`, exit `1` - confirms the test
  actually catches a wrong value, not just "does not crash."
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 172 passed, 6
  deselected; ruff clean; black clean (27 files unchanged) - unaffected,
  confirming the two new Python files don't touch anything already
  gated (no registration applies to this chunk).
- `python -m ruff check tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py` /
  `python -m black --check tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py` → both
  clean already.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` → 1 passed, 2 deselected, in
  153.99s (run in the background per this session's established
  practice, as an extra safety net - not one of Section 7's strictly-
  mandatory chunks, but this chunk rewrote production code the real
  launchers invoke) - confirms the J100/J50 authoritative workflows,
  which both invoke `plot_postfit.cpp`, still match the frozen
  scientific reference.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' plot_postfit.cpp
  tests/root_macros/test_read_bumphunter_results.cpp
  tests/root_macros/BHresults_sample.json
  tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py` → no output.
- `grep -n "#include\|#pragma" plot_postfit.cpp` (before vs. after) →
  identical include list, confirming guardrail 11.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)

1. Step A's commit (`2b7d168`) is named above; this commit's Step A test
   is kept unchanged as an end-to-end regression test; the new
   `read_bumphunter_results()` unit test is new, not relocated (no prior
   test existed to relocate).
2. Not applicable in the usual sense: `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`
   never imported `plot_postfit.cpp` (it always ran it as a subprocess),
   so there is no import line to diff.
3. Production code (the three shell launchers using `plot_postfit.cpp`)
   is unchanged, and `plot_postfit()`'s public entry point retains its
   exact original name and parameter order - confirmed by grep, not
   assumed.
4. No extracted function imports from `run_anaFit.py` or any Python
   module - this chunk is pure C++, unrelated to that module system.
5. Required Section 7 gates ran; output captured above, including the
   extra, non-mandatory integration-gate rerun.
6. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

### Remaining open chunks

Chunk 12 (`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`) is the only chunk left.

## 2026-09-03: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 12: `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` and final documentation

### Objective

Write `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`, modeled on `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`/
`doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s structure, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 12 - the final chunk, completing the plan. Single commit, no
production code change: like Chunk 8, guardrail 3's Step A/Step B
two-step pattern does not apply here, since there is no new target
function to characterize first.

### What changed

`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` created (new file), containing, at minimum, per
Chunk 12's own required-contents list:

- the module tables from the plan's Sections 4.1 and 4.3, updated with
  actual final function signatures - read directly from the finished
  source files (`grep -nE '^(def |class )'` against each of the seven
  `run_anaFit.py` modules, `plot_edm.py`, `python/plotPostFit.py`, and
  `plot_postfit.cpp`), not re-derived from memory or from earlier,
  possibly-superseded plan text;
- every "record the decision" point flagged in Chunks 5, 9, 10, and 11
  resolved and documented in a dedicated "Decisions recorded during
  extraction" section: `run_templates.py`'s internal decomposition and
  the preserved `nPars` quirk (Chunk 5); `parse_minuit_edm_log()`'s
  `FileNotFoundError`-propagation choice (Chunk 9); `python/plotPostFit.py`'s
  styling placement, `gStyle`/`gROOT.SetBatch()` relocation, and the
  `TFile`/`TLegend` lifetime fixes (Chunk 10); `plot_postfit.cpp`'s
  `exit(1)` placement and the `ResidualPanelKind`/`ResidualPanelInfo`
  addition beyond the plan's literal signature (Chunk 11);
- a test-file map from each module/file to its test file(s), including
  the two new ROOT-macro test files from Chunk 11
  (`tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py`,
  `tests/root_macros/test_read_bumphunter_results.cpp`), each row noting
  whether real ROOT/CVMFS is needed and, if so, for which specific
  tests;
- the unchanged Tier 1/2 gate commands (lightweight full gate, scientific
  gate), plus the plotting-layer real-ROOT commands this plan introduced,
  with a paragraph confirming they still cover every extracted module -
  the scientific gate specifically, since it reruns the real J100/J50
  launchers, which transitively invoke every one of the four Tier-3
  refactor targets for real;
- a "Known limitations" section naming: the two explicit, deliberate
  scope boundaries Chunk 11 already flagged (`load_postfit_histograms()`
  (C++) has no dedicated unit test; the `bump_hunter == true` masked
  path has no automated test at all); the `sys.modules`-stubbing-only
  testing of `collect_scientific_runtime()`/the `doprefit` branch (never
  against real ROOT/`PreFit` in a unit test, only end-to-end via the
  scientific gate); the two preserved pre-existing landmines (the
  `native_params`/`masked_params` null-pointer risk in
  `plot_postfit.cpp`, and the `nPars` double-match quirk in
  `run_templates.py`); and the plan's own out-of-scope boundary (only
  the four named files were touched).

### Every claim was verified before being written, not just asserted

- The "`run_anaFit.py` imports only from the seven modules, never the
  reverse" claim: verified via `grep -rn "run_anaFit"
  python/run_execution.py python/run_manifest.py python/run_provenance.py
  python/run_masking.py python/run_templates.py python/run_fit.py
  python/run_cli.py` returning nothing (exit code 1) before writing the
  claim.
- The `should_mask()` NaN-handling description: read directly from
  `python/run_masking.py`'s own source and its inline comment, not
  reconstructed from memory.
- The "every real-ROOT/CVMFS test is marked both `requires_root` and
  `requires_analysis_dependencies`" claim: verified by grepping the
  decorators immediately preceding every `def test_` in
  `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`, `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`, and
  `tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py` directly, confirming the three
  `parse_args()`-only tests correctly have neither marker and all seven
  real-ROOT tests correctly have both.
- The "172 passed, 6 deselected" and "27 files unchanged" lightweight-gate
  numbers, and the "11 passed... 87.29 seconds" plotting-layer-gate
  number, were both obtained by actually rerunning the gates fresh in
  this session, immediately before writing them into the document - not
  copied from an earlier, possibly-stale chunk entry. The scientific-gate
  number (1 passed, 153.99s) is cited from Chunk 11.B (commit `b026efd`,
  the most recent commit that could have changed scientific behavior);
  this chunk makes no production change, so re-running the ~3-minute
  scientific gate again was judged unnecessary and is not claimed as
  freshly re-verified in this commit.

### Verification performed

- Manual review: re-read the finished document top to bottom against the
  actual module and test files it describes (see the spot-checks above),
  confirming every claim has a citation, per the plan's own acceptance
  check.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` → no output.
- `git diff --check` → passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` (rerun fresh for this
  entry's own citations) → 172 passed, 6 deselected; ruff clean; black
  clean (27 files unchanged); exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py -v
  tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py -v`
  → 11 passed (9 + 2), 87.29 seconds, exit code 0, run for real against
  this host's actual CVMFS/LCG scientific runtime.
- No integration-gate rerun in this commit: no production file changed,
  so the Chunk 11.B result (`b026efd`, 1 passed, 153.99s) remains the
  current, accurate citation.

### Compliance review

1. Chunk 12, single commit (no Step A/Step B split applies - no target
   function exists to characterize, matching Chunk 8's precedent).
2. Every required-contents item from Chunk 12's own list is present:
   updated module tables, resolved decision points, test-file map, gate
   commands with confirmation of continued coverage, and a Known
   Limitations section.
3. No production code touched - `git status --short` shows only
   `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` as new/untracked before this commit.
4. Every factual claim was checked against the actual repository state
   in this session before being written, not carried forward from
   possibly-stale earlier chunk text.
5. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

### Remaining open chunks

None. All twelve chunks of `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are complete.

## 2026-09-04: Wire the ROOT regression tests into CI and correct the paired-pointer contract (GitHub Copilot review, PR #6)

### Objective

Resolve the two findings from GitHub Copilot's review of PR #6, both
raised against the Chunk 11/Chunk 12 work:

1. (Medium) `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` and
   `tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py` are absent from
   `scripts/quality_check.py`'s `test_targets`, and the hosted scientific
   workflow only invokes `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`.
   Neither new ROOT regression test therefore ran in any CI job, and both
   Python wrappers also escaped Ruff/Black.
2. (Low) `plot_postfit.cpp`'s `load_postfit_histograms()` comment claims
   all four `TFile *` parameters "may be null", but `native_params`/
   `masked_params` are dereferenced unconditionally inside their
   partner's guard, so a caller following the stated contract crashes.

Both were verified against the repository before any change, not taken at
face value:

- `grep -n "pytest" .github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` shows the
  only three pytest invocations in the hosted job are
  `tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies"`,
  `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -k
  authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime`, and
  `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and
  requires_root"`. `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml` runs
  `scripts/quality_check.py`, whose `test_targets` did not list either
  file. Finding 1 confirmed: neither file ran anywhere in CI.
- Reading `load_postfit_histograms()` directly confirms
  `native_params->Get<TH1D>("postfit_params")` sits inside
  `if (native) { ... }` with no null check of `native_params` itself
  (same for the masked pair). Finding 2 confirmed as a documentation
  defect; the code behavior itself is the pre-existing landmine this plan
  deliberately preserved, and is not changed here.

### What changed

- `scripts/quality_check.py`: added `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`
  and `tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py` to `test_targets`, in
  alphabetical position. This buys Ruff/Black coverage only - every test
  in both files carries `requires_analysis_dependencies`, so the ordinary
  gate's pytest phase still deselects all of them, which is exactly the
  behavior Copilot's comment described as acceptable ("the existing
  marker can still keep them out of the lightweight pytest phase").
- `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`: added a final step, "Run
  plotting-layer real-ROOT regression gates", which sources
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` (same preamble and same failure
  annotation as every other scientific step in that job) and then runs
  `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py
  tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py
  -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`. The step is placed in this job
  specifically because it is the only one with CVMFS: it mounts
  `atlas.cern.ch`/`sft.cern.ch` via the `cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs`
  step and verifies the mounts before use.
  Scope note: Copilot named only the two new wrapper files, but
  `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`'s four real-ROOT tests were in exactly
  the same position - registered for linting, but marker-deselected
  everywhere and run by no CI job. Fixing only the two named files would
  have left two thirds of the plotting layer's real-ROOT coverage still
  unreachable in CI, so all three files are included.
- `plot_postfit.cpp`: rewrote `load_postfit_histograms()`'s leading
  comment to state the paired-pointer requirement explicitly
  (`native_params` must be non-null whenever `native` is; likewise for
  the masked pair; passing a null params pointer alongside a non-null
  partner crashes), replacing the previous "any of which may be null"
  wording. Comment-only: no statement, signature, or behavior changed.
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`: brought in line with the above, and corrected
  three claims found to be wrong when this branch was reviewed end to
  end:
  - the `run_masking.py` row said `should_mask()` was "fixed post-hoc to
    treat `NaN` as 'not maskable' rather than raising". Both halves are
    backwards: verified directly that `should_mask(float("nan"), 0.01)`
    returns `True` (NaN *does* require masking, matching the original
    coordinator's `if p_value > threshold:` gating), and the pre-fix
    version returned `False` rather than raising. Rewritten to state the
    `not (p_value > threshold)` vs `p_value <= threshold` distinction and
    cite the proving test.
  - the "Gate commands" closing paragraph claimed the scientific gate
    exercises all four Tier-3 refactor targets "for real". Verified
    false: `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py` sets
    `ANAFIT_SKIP_PLOTS=1`, and `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`/
    `run_anaFit_J50.sh` gate both plotting invocations on that variable,
    so the gate covers `run_anaFit.py` and `plot_edm.py` (invoked
    unconditionally from `build_fit_extract()`) but not
    `python/plotPostFit.py` or `plot_postfit.cpp`. Rewritten as a
    three-bullet split stating which gate covers what, and why the
    plotting layer needed its own CI step.
  - the test-file map said `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` runs "via
    `tests/root_macros/`"; it invokes `plot_postfit.cpp` directly.
  - the `quality_check.py` registration paragraph (which said the two
    wrapper files are deliberately unregistered) and the plotting-layer
    gate section were updated to match the new registration and CI step;
    lightweight-gate numbers refreshed from 172 passed / 6 deselected /
    27 files to 172 passed / 8 deselected / 29 files.

### Verification performed

- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → 172 passed, 8
  deselected, ruff clean, black clean (29 files unchanged), exit code 0.
  Both newly-registered files are visibly present in the echoed ruff and
  black command lines.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py
  tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py
  -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" --collect-only -q` → 6/11
  collected, 5 deselected, listing exactly the four `test_plot_post_fit`
  real-ROOT tests plus the two macro wrappers. This is the precise
  selection the new CI step will make.
- `python -m pytest <the same three files> -m
  "requires_analysis_dependencies"` run for real against this host's
  CVMFS/LCG runtime → 6 passed, confirming `plot_postfit.cpp` still
  compiles and behaves identically after the comment rewrite.
- The workflow file was parsed with `yaml.safe_load` to confirm it is
  still valid YAML and that the new step is the 15th and last step of
  `complete-analysis-test-suite`, with its backslash continuations
  surviving the block scalar intact.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` over every changed file and `git diff
  --check` → both clean.
- No integration-gate rerun in this commit: no analysis-affecting
  production code changed (the only `.cpp` change is a comment), so the
  scientific gate result recorded for Chunk 11.B (`b026efd`, 1 passed,
  153.99 s) remains the current citation. It was, however, independently
  re-run at this branch's HEAD during the review that preceded this
  commit (`pytest -m "not requires_analysis_dependencies" tests/` → 174
  passed in 153.75 s, which selects it) and still matched the frozen
  reference.

### Compliance review

1. Only the two verified findings were acted on, plus the documentation
   claims that the CI change itself made stale and three factual errors
   found by direct verification against the repository. No unrelated
   cleanup.
2. No production behavior changed anywhere: the `.cpp` edit is a comment,
   `quality_check.py` gains two list entries, and the workflow gains a
   step. `run_anaFit.py` and the seven extracted modules are untouched.
3. No new dependency or tool was introduced; the new CI step reuses the
   existing setup preamble, the existing markers, and the existing
   pytest invocation style verbatim. The one marker change in this
   commit (see below) applies an existing, already-defined marker to one
   more test - it does not define a new one.
4. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section - except the "Known follow-up" subsection below,
   which was rewritten from "not done here" to "done here" before this
   entry was ever committed, per the append-only rule's own scope (it
   protects committed history, not a still-uncommitted draft of the
   entry describing the commit currently being prepared).

### Additional one-line fix folded into this commit

`tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py::test_authoritative_j100_j50_workflows_match_frozen_reference`
carried `integration` and `requires_root` but not
`requires_analysis_dependencies`, so it was the one real-ROOT test this
plan's own stated rule ("any test that sources
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` carries both markers") did not cover.
Measured consequence before the fix: `pytest -m "not
requires_analysis_dependencies" tests/` selected it and ran a real
154-second fit, and would fail outright on a machine with no CVMFS - the
same failure mode fixed for the plotting tests in `6745188`. This was
raised during the same-branch review as a follow-up rather than acted on
immediately (it touches the scientific gate's own test file and is
outside both Copilot findings), and is now applied at the user's explicit
request alongside the two Copilot fixes above, in this same commit.

Added `@pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies` to that one test.
Verified both CI selectors are unaffected: `pytest
tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "not
requires_analysis_dependencies" --collect-only` now deselects it (1/3
collected, was 2/3); `pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py
-m "integration and requires_root" --collect-only` still selects exactly
it (1/3 collected) - the hosted scientific job's own selector is
unchanged. `scripts/quality_check.py` never listed this file in
`test_targets` at all, so it was never affected either way. Reran
`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` after this addition - 172
passed, 8 deselected, ruff/black clean (29 files unchanged), exit code 0,
unchanged from the pre-marker run - confirming the fix is inert to every
existing selector except the one it was meant to change.

## 2026-09-04: Fail-fast validation ordering, a dead parameter, and two documentation-accuracy fixes (same-branch review follow-up)

### Objective

Continue resolving the remaining, non-Copilot items raised during the
same-branch review that preceded the previous commit (`6855d4a`), at the
user's explicit request to "fix the rest of the issues found":

1. `run_fit.py`'s `fitresultfile` basename validation ran after the
   XMLReader subprocess, so a bad `fitresultfile` still paid for a full
   (expensive) workspace build before failing.
2. `run_templates.py`'s `_seed_prefit_parameters()` took an `nbkg`
   parameter that is unconditionally overwritten before any use inside
   the function - dead parameter-passing, not a behavior difference.
3. `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s Chunk 11 decision paragraph credited the
   Chunk 11.B byte-identical-PDF verification (41589 bytes) to
   `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`'s automated test, which
   deliberately does not assert byte-identical output (its own comment
   says so, matching `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`'s documented policy).

Two other items surfaced in the same review - `repository_dirty` added to
provenance without a `schema_version` bump, and the latent dual-module
hazard from `pyproject.toml`'s `pythonpath = [".", "python"]` - were
looked at again and deliberately left alone; see "Considered and not
changed" below.

### What changed

- `python/run_fit.py`: the `fitresultfile` basename check (added by an
  earlier Copilot-fix commit, `9f1956a`) moved from between the XMLReader
  and quickFit calls to the very top of `build_fit_extract()`, before
  `xmlreader_command` is even constructed. Comment updated from "before
  quickFit launches" to "before either XMLReader or quickFit launches",
  with the fail-fast rationale stated explicitly. Pure code motion of a
  stateless check that only reads `fitresultfile` - no other statement
  before it in the function depended on anything the check itself
  produces beyond `fitresult_dir`/`fitresult_name`, both of which move
  with it.
- `tests/test_run_fit.py`::`test_build_fit_extract_rejects_fitresultfile_without_fitresult_token`
  strengthened to match: the comment explaining the ordering change, and
  the trailing assertion tightened from "quickFit never reached" (`assert
  "quickFit background or signal fit" not in calls`) to "neither
  subprocess reached at all" (`assert calls == []`) - the test now
  actually proves the new fail-fast behavior, not just its weaker,
  pre-existing guarantee.
- `python/run_templates.py`: removed `_seed_prefit_parameters()`'s
  `nbkg` parameter and the corresponding `nbkg=nbkg` keyword argument at
  its one call site inside `_stage_xml_templates()`. Verified dead by
  direct reading: the parameter is declared, never read anywhere in the
  function body, then unconditionally reassigned from the `PreFitter`'s
  own fitted background count (`nbkg = "%.1E, 0, %.1E" % (_nbkg, 2 *
  _nbkg)`) before its only use (the `return nbkg` at the end). True of
  the original single-scope script's identical local-variable
  reassignment too - this was inert noise introduced by the Chunk 5
  extraction, not a preserved behavior difference. No test called
  `_seed_prefit_parameters()` directly with an `nbkg=` keyword (confirmed
  by grep), so no test needed updating.
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`:
  - `run_templates.py`'s module-map row and the Chunk 5 decision
    paragraph updated for the new `_seed_prefit_parameters()` signature,
    with the removed-parameter history and reasoning recorded inline.
  - the Chunk 11 decision paragraph rewritten: the automated test is now
    credited only with what it actually proves (exit `0`, real non-empty
    `post_fit.pdf`); the byte-identical 41589-byte claim is now
    attributed to the one-time manual verification recorded in this same
    file's Chunk 11.B entry, with an explicit note that the automated
    test does not repeat or enforce it on every run.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py tests/test_run_templates.py -v`
  → 11 passed. The strengthened assertion (`calls == []`) passing
  confirms XMLReader is genuinely never invoked once the check moved
  ahead of it, not just that quickFit is skipped.
- `grep -n "_seed_prefit_parameters(" tests/test_run_templates.py` →
  no direct calls (only through `prepare_run_templates`/
  `_stage_xml_templates`, both of which keep their own `nbkg` parameter
  unchanged), confirming the signature change had no test blast radius.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` (rerun fresh after both
  code changes) → 172 passed, 8 deselected, ruff clean, black clean (29
  files unchanged), exit code 0 - identical to the pre-fix run, showing
  neither change touched anything the lightweight gate exercises beyond
  the two files edited.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` over every changed file and `git diff
  --check` → both clean.
- Scientific gate rerun (`python -m pytest
  tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and
  requires_root" -v`) - see result recorded below; `build_fit_extract()`
  and `prepare_run_templates()` are both on this gate's real,
  authoritative code path, so a rerun (not just the lightweight gate) is
  the correct verification for behavior-affecting production changes,
  unlike the previous, comment-only commit. Result: **1 passed, 2
  deselected, 172.97 seconds, exit code 0** -
  `test_authoritative_j100_j50_workflows_match_frozen_reference` still
  matches the frozen `tests/references/analysis_reference.json` exactly.
  This run happened to exercise both edits for real, not just in
  isolation: it was observed mid-run (`ps aux`) actually executing
  `python/run_anaFit.py --doprefit` against the real J100 fixture, which
  drives `run_templates.py`'s `doprefit` branch (and therefore
  `_seed_prefit_parameters()`, whose `nbkg` parameter was just removed)
  and `run_fit.py`'s `build_fit_extract()` (whose validation check was
  just reordered ahead of the real XMLReader subprocess call it now
  precedes) on the authoritative code path, not a stub.

### Considered and not changed

- **`analysis_results.json`'s `repository_dirty` field was added under
  `schema_version: 2` rather than a new version** (`a83e888`, prior to
  this session). Checked against repository history before deciding not
  to act: this repeats an already-established, precedented pattern in
  this repository (an earlier 2026-08-27 schema change made the
  identical choice - see `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`'s own schema-version-2
  entries from that date), and both times shipped with a full
  regeneration of the two tracked canonical manifests in the same
  commit, so no stale `schema_version: 2` manifest missing the new field
  is left committed in this repository. Not a Tier 3 concern (it
  predates this plan's own commits) and not something this branch's
  review is the right place to relitigate unilaterally. Documented as a
  Known Limitation in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` instead of changed.
- **The latent dual-module-import hazard from `pyproject.toml`'s
  `pythonpath = [".", "python"]`** - confirmed directly
  (`python.run_execution is not run_execution` inside one interpreter)
  that a module is reachable two ways with two distinct module objects.
  Not changed: removing either `pythonpath` entry would break real,
  currently-passing tests that depend on it (the flat-style entry for
  `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`'s own module-loading helper; the dotted
  entry for every other test file's `from python.<module> import ...`
  style), and no test in this repository currently straddles both styles
  for the same module, so there is no live bug to fix, only a documented
  risk for future test-writing. Documented as a Known Limitation in
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` instead of changed.

### Compliance review

1. Every change traces to a specific, verified finding from the review
   that preceded this commit - two real code fixes (fail-fast ordering,
   dead parameter) and two documentation-accuracy fixes - plus two items
   deliberately left alone and recorded as Known Limitations rather than
   silently dropped.
2. Both code changes are pure refactors with no change to any success
   path's output: `run_fit.py`'s check is relocated, not altered, and
   still raises the identical `ValueError` with the identical message;
   `run_templates.py`'s removed parameter was provably dead (never read
   before being overwritten), so nothing observable changed. The
   scientific gate rerun (not just the lightweight gate) confirms this
   for the real J100 workflow, including the exact `doprefit` and
   XMLReader code paths touched.
3. No new dependency, tool, or marker was introduced.
4. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

## 2026-09-04: End-to-end execution trace of the J100 launcher, and a fixed finding (`python/createBinning.py`)

### Objective

Trace `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` from invocation to its final output
artifacts, listing every file it executes along the way, and document
which of those files do not follow the Tier 3 decomposition-and-testing
system (`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`). The trace surfaced one real defect
(`python/createBinning.py` fails to parse); the user then asked for it to
be fixed and tested by rerunning the analysis, folded into this same
entry rather than a separate one, since nothing from the trace-only work
had been committed yet.

### What changed

- Added `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`: a full call-graph trace of one
  real J100 run (`FIT_PARS=six`, `sigmean=400`, `dosignal=0`, `dolimit=0`,
  `doprefit=1`), from `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` through
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`, `python/run_anaFit.py` and its seven
  Tier 3 modules, into the external XMLReader/quickFit submodule binaries,
  the plotting layer, and back out to the final output files. Classifies
  every file the trace touches into three categories: part of the Tier 3
  system (cites `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` directly rather than repeating it),
  legitimately outside Tier 3's documented scope but still on this repo's
  own code (`python/PreFit.py`, `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`,
  `ExtractFitParameters.py`, `createBinning.py`, `FindBHWindow.py`,
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`), and a different category entirely -
  third-party code in external Git submodules (`xmlAnaWSBuilder`,
  `quickFit`, `pyBumpHunter`, `workspaceCombiner`, confirmed via
  `.gitmodules`).
- Added a cross-reference from `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s "Purpose and
  audience" section to the new trace document.
- **Found, while tracing, that `python/createBinning.py` did not
  parse**: `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('python/createBinning.py').read())"`
  raised `IndentationError: unexpected indent` at line 11. Root-caused to
  a stray one-space indent on the `tfile`/`IsZombie`/`reso_fit` null-check
  block, introduced in commit `e6bfd96` (2026-07-30). Confirmed this was
  dormant: `run_fit.py`'s `build_fit_extract()` only calls this script
  when `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/mjjResolutionBinning_<rangelow>.root` is
  missing, and both fixtures this repository's tests actually use
  (`mjjResolutionBinning_481.root` for J100, `mjjResolutionBinning_344.root`
  for J50) are already committed, so that branch had never fired in the
  scientific gate or CI.
- **Fixed** `python/createBinning.py`: dedented the five affected lines
  back to column 0, matching every other top-level statement in the
  file. Pure whitespace change - no other line touched, no logic altered.
  Documented in `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`'s Section 5 (rewritten
  from "found, not fixed" to "found and fixed", with the fix's own
  verification recorded there); the earlier "Purpose and audience"
  cross-reference in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` updated to match. Explicitly
  out of scope for this fix: `createBinning.py` is still not decomposed
  into functions, still has no dedicated test file, and is still
  unregistered in `scripts/quality_check.py` - it remains outside the
  Tier 3 system, just no longer syntactically broken. Also out of scope:
  this repository has no committed `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/resolutionFits.root`
  at all (the file this script's own logic reads) - a separate,
  pre-existing gap, noted but not addressed here.

### Verification performed

- Every file in the trace was read directly (`run_anaFit.py`,
  `run_masking.py`, `run_fit.py`, `run_templates.py`,
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`, `python/PreFit.py`,
  `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`, `ExtractFitParameters.py`,
  `createBinning.py`, `FindBHWindow.py`), not inferred from
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s existing descriptions.
- `grep -rn` across `tests/` for each of the five out-of-scope files'
  class/module names, confirming every match is a `ModuleType` stub used
  to isolate a Tier 3 module under test, or a subprocess command-string
  assertion in the integration test - never a direct unit test of that
  file's own logic.
- `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(...)"` run individually against all
  five out-of-scope Python files at trace time; only `createBinning.py`
  failed.
- Confirmed both `mjjResolutionBinning_481.root`/`mjjResolutionBinning_344.root`
  are tracked and present, and that 481/344 match J100's/J50's own
  `rangelow` values in the two launcher scripts.
- Confirmed via `.gitmodules` and `git submodule status` that
  `xmlAnaWSBuilder`, `quickFit`, `pyBumpHunter`, `workspaceCombiner` are
  external submodules, not this repository's own code.
- Fix verification: `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(...)"` now
  succeeds on `createBinning.py`. Ran the fixed script for real, exactly
  as `run_fit.py` invokes it (`python3 python/createBinning.py -s 481 -e
  3000 -o <path>`), against a synthetic `resolutionFits.root` built on
  the fly with a trivial `TF1` named `gsc_mjj_reso_fit` (a real one isn't
  committed to this repository at all - noted above, not addressed
  here): exit 0, and the resulting file contained a real `mjjBinning`
  `TH1F` with 38 bins spanning exactly `[481, 3000]`, confirmed by
  reading it back with `ROOT.TFile.Open(...)`. Both the synthetic input
  and the scratch output were deleted afterward; `git status` on
  `Input/` came back clean.
- Reran the scientific gate
  (`tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and
  requires_root"`) end to end against the fix: **1 passed, 2 deselected,
  289.19 seconds, exit code 0** - `ps aux` confirmed mid-run it was
  genuinely executing the real J100 `run_anaFit.py --doprefit` process,
  not passing coincidentally.
- Reran `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 172 passed, 8
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (29 files unchanged), exit code 0.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check` on all changed files:
  clean.

### Compliance review

1. The trace itself changed no production code (pure documentation),
   matching the original request; the one production-code change in this
   entry (`python/createBinning.py`'s dedent) was made only after the
   user explicitly asked for it, and is a one-line whitespace fix with no
   logic change.
2. The defect found is reported *and* fixed, with both the fix and its
   verification recorded plainly - root cause, why it was dormant, the
   fix itself, and the two-gate + direct-execution verification that
   proves it now works and regresses nothing.
3. No new dependency, tool, or marker introduced. `createBinning.py`
   remains unregistered in `quality_check.py` and undecomposed -
   explicitly not brought into Tier 3 compliance by this fix, since that
   was never asked for.
4. Activity-log entry appended and edited in place while still
   uncommitted (this content), not a rewrite of any already-committed
   entry.

## 2026-09-04: Extend the Tier 3 plan to the five hot-path support files (Chunks 13-18, planning only)

### Objective

The user asked for `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` to be updated so the
five hot-path support files `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` found outside
Tier 3 (`python/PreFit.py`, `python/ExtractFitParameters.py`,
`python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`, `python/createBinning.py`,
`python/FindBHWindow.py`) get decomposed and tested with the same
formula as Chunks 0-12. This entry covers **planning only**: writing
Chunks 13-18 into the plan document. Actually executing them (real
characterization tests, real extraction, real gates) is separate,
substantial follow-on work, explicitly not done here.

Two decisions were confirmed with the user before drafting: (1) reopen
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` itself rather than start a new Tier 4
document; (2) for two dormant bugs found in `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`
during design research, add two separate, optional, explicitly-scoped
fix chunks (16a/16b) rather than only document-and-preserve them (the
plan's default for every other quirk found).

### What changed

- `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`: Section 0 and Section 3 updated to
  describe the extended, nine-file scope (the original four-file scope
  is preserved as a dated historical statement, not silently rewritten).
  Section 4 gained subsections 4.4/4.5 (target decomposition tables and
  import/testing-tier notes for the five files). Section 6 gained Chunks
  13 (`createBinning.py`), 14 (`FindBHWindow.py`), 15
  (`ExtractFitParameters.py`), 16 (`ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`, the primary
  decomposition target) plus optional Chunks 16a/16b (the two dormant-bug
  fixes), 17 (`PreFit.py`), and 18 (a single-commit documentation update,
  to run only once Chunks 13-17 land) - each using the exact Step A/Step
  B table/prose template Chunks 1-11 already established. Section 7
  gained the `FindBHWindow.py` dedicated-interpreter gate command.
  Section 9's completion definition extended to "Chunks 0 through 18"
  with new bullets, including an explicit caveat that the standard
  scientific gate does not by itself prove `FindBHWindow.py`'s or fully
  `createBinning.py`'s correctness. Section 10's scope boundary updated
  "four" to "nine."
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` and `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`: one small,
  accurate pointer added/revised in each, noting Chunks 13-18 now exist
  as a plan but are **not yet executed** - deliberately not rewriting
  either document's actual-status claims, since none of the five files'
  real decomposition/testing has happened yet. `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`
  describes only what has actually happened (its own opening sentence's
  citation requirement) and is not updated further until Chunk 18 itself
  runs.

### Research performed before drafting

Two Explore agents read `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`/`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`
in full (exact section structure, chunk template, guardrails, every
"Tier 3 is complete" claim with line numbers) and all five target files
plus their real call sites and existing test-stub patterns in full. A
Plan agent then designed the concrete per-file decomposition against
that fact base. Two corrections to initial assumptions were found by
direct verification during that research, both recorded in the plan
itself: `numpy` is not importable in `.venv/bin/python` (affects Chunk
14's test design); and `ExtractFitParameters`/`ExtractPostfitFromWS`'s
shared `wsfile` constructor parameter is actually the fit-result file in
production for both classes, not the workspace file either name
suggests (confirmed directly from `run_fit.py:114-168`).

### Verification performed

- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` across all three changed docs: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `grep -n "the four named\|four files\|Chunks 0-12\|Chunks 0 through 12\|no other file is in scope" doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`:
  the four remaining hits are all legitimate local/historical references
  (Chunk 12's own "as it stood at Chunk 12's completion" framing; Chunk
  17's "these four files" meaning four of the *five new* files that keep
  a module-level `import ROOT`; Chunk 15's "the other four files" meaning
  the other four of the five new files; Chunk 18's own acceptance-check
  text) - none is a stale document-wide scope claim.
- Confirmed all 8 new/optional chunk headers (13, 14, 15, 16, 16a, 16b,
  17, 18) present, in order, via `grep -n "^### Chunk 1[3-8]"`.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 172 passed, 8
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (29 files unchanged), exit code 0 -
  unaffected, since no production code changed.

### Compliance review

1. This is a planning-document change only - no production code, no
   test file, no `scripts/quality_check.py` registration change (there is
   nothing new to register yet; the five target files' real test files
   don't exist until Chunks 13-17 are actually executed).
2. Every quirk/bug found in the five target files during design research
   is preserved in the plan text with an explicit preserve-or-fix
   decision and rationale, matching this repository's established
   "characterize and preserve, never silently clean up" principle -
   including the two dormant bugs the user explicitly chose to schedule
   fix chunks for (16a/16b), each kept separate from Chunk 16's own
   extraction commit.
3. `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s and `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`'s
   actual-status claims were not rewritten to describe unexecuted work as
   done - only a small, accurate forward-pointer was added to each.
4. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

## 2026-09-04: Resolve Chunks 13/14's two open pre-Step-A verification items

### Objective

Chunks 13 and 14 of `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` (added earlier today)
each flagged one fact that needed direct confirmation before their real
Step A could be written: Chunk 13's `.Get(...)` key name, and Chunk 14's
committed-fixture directory-structure requirement. Both are resolved here
by direct verification - closing out the last open items in the planning
stage - with one significant, unplanned discovery surfaced along the way.

### What changed

- `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 13: replaced the "confirm this
  directly" hedge with the confirmed key name (`"gsc_mjj_reso_fit"`, read
  directly from `python/createBinning.py`'s own `.Get(...)` call - matches
  what was already assumed).
- `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 14: replaced the "not yet verified"
  paragraph with a confirmed fact - the committed
  `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
  does carry both `Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned/postfit` and
  `Run3TLA_rebinned/data` (confirmed by opening it and walking its
  `TDirectory` structure with ROOT directly) - no synthetic fixture
  needed for Chunk 14 either, same as Chunks 15/16.
- Added a new paragraph to Chunk 14 recording an unplanned discovery made
  while resolving the above: `run/fits/run_135_1000_sixPar/` and
  `run/fits/run_135_1000_sevenPar/` are real, committed, tracked masked-
  fit fixtures (`PostFit_*_masked.root`, `FitParameters_*_masked.root`,
  and a real `BHresults.json`, confirmed via `git ls-files`) - not
  produced by either current launcher script, not referenced by any test
  today. This directly contradicts `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s existing Known
  Limitations claim that "No masked-fit fixture... exists in this
  repository" (written for `plot_postfit.cpp`'s Chunk 11). Left as an
  explicitly open decision for whoever picks up Chunk 14 - not acted on
  in this pass, since neither correcting that claim nor changing Chunk
  14's design was what this pass was asked to do.

### Verification performed

- `grep -n '\.Get(' python/createBinning.py` - confirms the key name.
- Opened `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
  directly with ROOT and walked its full `TDirectory` tree - confirms
  both required category subdirectories are present.
- `git ls-files run/fits/run_135_1000_sixPar/ run/fits/run_135_1000_sevenPar/`
  - confirms the masked fixtures are real and tracked, not local-only
  artifacts.
- `grep -rln "run_135_1000" tests/` - confirms no test references them.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` and
  `git diff --check`: clean.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 172 passed, 8
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0 (unaffected - no
  production code changed).

### Compliance review

1. Both resolved items are read-only verification, not chunk execution -
   still within the planning stage the user asked about, not a start of
   Chunks 13/14's actual work.
2. The masked-fixture discovery is recorded plainly, not silently
   dropped or acted on unilaterally - it touches an already-committed
   doc's claim and a chunk's own design, both left for explicit decision.
3. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

## 2026-09-04: Untrack non-canonical analysis output (run/fits/run_135_1000_*)

### Objective

The user stated a repository policy: analysis-run outputs should
generally not be tracked in git unless needed for Tier 1/2 comparison.
Applied directly to `run/fits/run_135_1000_sixPar/` and
`run/fits/run_135_1000_sevenPar/` - the masked-fit fixture directories
surfaced by the previous entry's discovery.

### What changed

- `git rm` both directories (51 tracked files total: `PostFit_*.root`,
  `FitResult_*.root`, `FitParameters_*.root`, both masked and unmasked,
  `BHresults.json`, XML templates, PDFs, logs, `AnaWSBuilder.dtd`) -
  removed from both the git index and the working tree.
- `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 14's "related discovery" paragraph
  (added in the previous entry) rewritten from "not yet acted on" to
  "since resolved" - records that the removal restores
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s existing Known Limitations claim ("No
  masked-fit fixture... exists in this repository") to being accurate
  again, and that `FindBHWindow.py`'s masked path remains untested by any
  committed fixture (Chunk 14's own dedicated-interpreter subprocess test
  is still the only real proof of its correctness, on the unmasked case).
- Saved the underlying policy as a persistent project memory (this
  session's memory store), including the nuance found while
  investigating: J100/J50's own tracked non-JSON output files
  (`PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root` etc.) are legitimately tracked
  despite going beyond `analysis_results.json` - they match
  `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s own documented canonical output contract and
  are real, load-bearing fixtures `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py` reads by
  path directly. `run_135_1000_*` matched none of those three criteria.

### Verification performed

- `grep -rln "run_135_1000" tests/`: confirmed zero references before
  removal.
- Confirmed neither current launcher script (`scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`/
  `run_anaFit_J50.sh`) uses `rangelow=135`.
- Confirmed via `.gitignore`'s `run/*`/`run/**` rules (with only
  `!run/fits/J100/...`/`!run/fits/J50/...` re-including the canonical two
  directories) that these files were never meant to be tracked in the
  first place.
- `git status --short` after `git rm`: only the expected deletions.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` and
  `git diff --check`: clean.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 172 passed, 8
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0 - confirms no test
  depended on the removed files. The scientific gate was not rerun for
  this change: it generates its own fresh run in a `tmp_path` and does
  not read `run/fits/run_135_1000_*` at all, and no production code was
  touched.

### Compliance review

1. Action taken only after explicit user confirmation (asked via a
   direct yes/no choice before removing tracked files).
2. Verified via grep that nothing depended on the removed files before
   removing them, not assumed.
3. The stale plan-document paragraph referencing these files as a
   reusable fixture was corrected in the same commit as their removal,
   not left dangling.
4. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

## Chunk 13.A — Characterization tests for python/createBinning.py

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `python/createBinning.py`
(a flat 32-line top-level script, zero functions, no `main()`, no
`__main__` guard) before any extraction, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 13.

### Target functions — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)

There are no functions to characterize individually - the whole file is
one top-to-bottom script body, run only ever as a subprocess in
production (`run_fit.py`'s `execute("python3 python/createBinning.py
-s {rangelow} -e {rangehigh} -o {binningFileName}")`). Characterized as
a single whole-script unit, mirroring Chunk 10.A's own precedent for
`plotPostFit.py` before its extraction:

| Unit | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| whole script | `-s/--start`, `-e/--end`, `-o/--output` CLI args; a `resolutionFits.root` file at the hardcoded path `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/resolutionFits.root`, containing a `"gsc_mjj_reso_fit"` object exposing `.Eval(x)` | writes a `TH1F` named `"mjjBinning"` to `-o`'s path | opens/reads the hardcoded input file; raises `OSError`/`KeyError` if it's missing or the key isn't found |

### Tests added

- `test_createBinning_script_produces_expected_binning_for_real_fixture`
  — builds a synthetic `resolutionFits.root` (a flat 5%-resolution `TF1`
  named `"gsc_mjj_reso_fit"`) at the real, hardcoded input path (this
  repository commits no real one - confirmed via `find`, and recorded in
  `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` Section 5), runs the unmodified script
  for real against range `[481, 3000]`, and asserts the output file
  contains a `mjjBinning` `TH1F` with exactly **38 bins spanning
  `[481, 3000]`** - the same result already observed once this session
  during the syntax-bug fix, so this test both pins current behavior and
  cross-checks that prior observation. The synthetic input file is
  removed in a `finally` block regardless of outcome, and the test
  refuses to run at all (asserts first) if a real `resolutionFits.root`
  ever exists, to never risk overwriting one.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file is modified. `python/createBinning.py` is unchanged
byte-for-byte in this diff - confirmed with `git diff --stat` (only
`tests/test_create_binning.py` and this activity-log entry appear).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_create_binning.py -v` -> **1 passed,
  98.02s** (real ROOT/RooFit runtime, sourced
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`), rerun a second time after a
  Black-reformat of the test file itself (whitespace only) to confirm
  the reformat changed nothing observable - both runs passed.
- `python -m ruff check tests/test_create_binning.py` /
  `python -m black --check tests/test_create_binning.py`: clean (one
  line-length finding was fixed via Black before this commit).
- `git diff --stat` (before staging): only `tests/test_create_binning.py`
  - confirms no production file touched.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 172 passed, 8
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0 - unaffected, since
  the new file is not yet registered (Step B's job).
- `git status --short Input/`: clean after the test run - the synthetic
  fixture was removed as intended.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

- [x] Base commit for these tests: `bdccd29` (this branch's tip
  immediately before this commit) - `python/createBinning.py` is
  identical to its state as fixed and verified in the earlier
  `d66a73c` commit.
- [x] The new test asserts a real output (histogram bin count and exact
  bin edges), not merely "does not raise."
- [x] `git diff --stat` shows no production file touched.
- [x] The test was run for real, twice, and its output reviewed directly
  (not only reported) - confirming both the exit code and the exact
  bin-count/edge assertions against the real subprocess output.
- [x] Human-verification checkpoint: reviewed and confirmed in this same
  session before Step B's commit follows.

## Chunk 13.B — Extract python/createBinning.py into named functions

### Objective

Move the whole-script logic characterized in Step A (commit `e77724f`)
into named, individually-tested functions plus a `main()` and a new
`if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 13.

### What changed

- `python/createBinning.py` restructured from a flat 32-line top-level
  script into `parse_args(argv=None)`, `load_resolution_fit(input_path=...)`,
  `resolve_bin_edges(reso_fit, rangelow, rangehigh)`,
  `build_binning_histogram(bin_edges)`, `main(argv=None)`, and a new
  `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` guard this file previously lacked
  (matching Chunk 10's `plotPostFit.py` precedent exactly).
- `import ROOT` deferred from module scope into the three functions that
  actually touch it (`load_resolution_fit`, `build_binning_histogram`,
  `main`) - **not explicitly in the plan's original text**, added after
  confirming directly that a module-level `import ROOT` would have broken
  the plan's own stated goal ("both need zero ROOT" for `parse_args()`/
  `resolve_bin_edges()`): `.venv/bin/python -c "from python import
  createBinning"` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'ROOT'` before this fix, and succeeded after. Matches every other
  deferred-import module in this plan (`run_fit.py`, `run_provenance.py`,
  `run_templates.py`).
- The hardcoded input path and `from array import array`'s deferred
  placement (now inside `build_binning_histogram`) preserved verbatim,
  per the plan.
- `tests/test_create_binning.py` gained 7 new tests: 3 for `parse_args()`,
  3 for `resolve_bin_edges()` (against a hand-written `_FakeResolutionFit`
  exposing only `.Eval(x)` - zero ROOT, one cross-checking the real
  fixture's own 38-bin/[481,3000] result via an independently-verified
  edge list, one with a different resolution/range, one confirming the
  `rangehigh` clamp), and 2 for `load_resolution_fit()`'s failure paths
  (both real ROOT, marked). Step A's end-to-end test kept unchanged
  (Test Relocation Rule - it was already written directly into its final
  file, so nothing needed moving), now exercising the extracted `main()`
  instead of the original inline script.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: `python/createBinning.py` and
  `tests/test_create_binning.py` registered in
  `python_targets`/`test_targets`.

### A real finding, verified and preserved, not fixed

While testing `load_resolution_fit()`'s failure paths directly, found
that on this repository's own installed PyROOT, `ROOT.TFile.Open()`
itself raises its own `OSError` for a missing file - a different message
than the function's own `if not tfile or tfile.IsZombie(): raise
OSError("Could not open Input/data/dijetisrTLA/resolutionFits.root")`
guard, which is therefore currently unreachable in practice here. This
is pre-existing behavior from the original single-scope script (the
check is unchanged), not something this extraction introduced, and it is
not dead code on every PyROOT build (some return a null `TFile` instead
of raising, which is exactly what the guard defends against) - preserved
verbatim, documented in a new source comment, not removed or "fixed."
The `KeyError` path (a valid, openable file simply missing the expected
key) **is** genuinely reached by this function's own code - confirmed
separately and given its own passing test.

Also verified directly, mirroring Chunk 10.B's own file-lifetime check:
unlike `plotPostFit.py`'s `TH1` objects, a ROOT `TF1` read back via
`TFile::Get()` stays evaluable after its owning `TFile` is closed (tested
both after the file object merely fell out of scope with `gc.collect()`
forced, and after an explicit `.Close()` call - both still returned the
correct value). `load_resolution_fit()` therefore safely returns only
the fit object and closes the file itself, rather than needing to hand
the file back to the caller the way `plotPostFit.py`'s
`load_postfit_histograms()` must.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`run_fit.py`'s call site (`execute(f"python3 python/createBinning.py -s
{rangelow} -e {rangehigh} -o {binningFileName}")`) is unchanged -
confirmed by `grep -n "createBinning" python/run_fit.py`. The extracted
script was run for real, exactly as `run_fit.py` invokes it, against a
synthetic fixture, and produced the identical 38-bin
`[481, 3000]` result already verified twice before (once during the
syntax-bug fix, once in Chunk 13.A). The integration-gate rerun below
confirms zero regression to the real J100/J50 workflows, though - as
already stated in Chunk 13's own plan text - that gate never exercises
this branch at all (both committed binning fixtures already exist), so
it proves no regression to the always-taken existence check, not this
chunk's own correctness; the real proof is the direct script run above
plus the 11 passing tests.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_create_binning.py -v` -> **11 passed,
  63.51s** (8 fast/unmarked in 0.06s, 3 real-ROOT in the remainder).
- Ran the extracted script directly, exactly as `run_fit.py` invokes it,
  against a synthetic fixture: exit 0, produced a real 38-bin
  `mjjBinning` histogram spanning `[481, 3000]`, confirmed by reading it
  back; `git status --short Input/` clean afterward.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **180 passed, 11
  deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean (31 files unchanged), exit code
  0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` -> **1 passed, 2 deselected,
  159.63 seconds, exit code 0**.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `grep -n "createBinning" python/run_fit.py`: confirms the call site is
  byte-for-byte unchanged.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)

- [x] Step A's commit (`e77724f`) named above; this commit's relocated
  test is unchanged from it (nothing needed moving - it was already
  written into its final file).
- [x] No scientific constant, reference, tolerance, dependency revision,
  or canonical workflow argument touched.
- [x] `resolve_bin_edges()`'s two new fake-based tests are genuinely new,
  independently-verified assertions, not copied from Step A.
- [x] Every newly-introduced function has a dedicated test (success path
  for all four; failure path for `load_resolution_fit()` and
  `parse_args()`'s required-flag rejection).
- [x] `run_fit.py` still calls `python/createBinning.py` by the same
  subprocess command - confirmed by grep, not assumed.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] This entry names Chunk 13 as now resolved; Chunks 14-18 remain
  explicitly open.

## Chunk 14.A — Characterization tests for python/FindBHWindow.py

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of `python/FindBHWindow.py`
(a 113-line script: one clean `NpEncoder` class plus a `main(args)` that
holds the entire real workflow) before any extraction, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 14.

### Target functions/classes — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)

| Unit | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NpEncoder.default(obj)` | any object `json.dumps` can't natively serialize | `int`/`float`/`list`, or delegates to `super().default()` | none |
| `main(args)` (whole workflow) | CLI args (`--inputfile`, `--bkghist`, `--datahist`, `--outputjson`, `--usebinnumbers`, plus unused `--inputxmlcard`/`--outputxmlcard`) | writes `outputjson` (`MaskMin`/`MaskMax`/`BlindRange`/`pyBHresult`); prints the blind range | opens `inputfile` via `uproot`; runs a `pyBumpHunter.BumpHunter1D` scan; writes hardcoded `bump.png`/`BH_statistics.png` to the current directory |

### Tests added

- `test_npencoder_serializes_numpy_integer` /
  `_floating` / `_ndarray` / `_falls_back_to_default_for_unknown_types` —
  characterize `NpEncoder.default()` directly, using a fake `numpy`
  module (real, instantiable `integer`/`floating`/`ndarray` classes) plus
  trivial empty fakes for `matplotlib`/`matplotlib.pyplot`/`uproot`/
  `pyBumpHunter` - the first use of a `numpy` module-name stub in this
  plan, since real `numpy` is not importable in this repository's own
  pytest dev venv either (confirmed directly).
- `test_findbhwindow_script_computes_expected_mask_window_for_real_fixture`
  — runs the real, unmodified script against the already-committed J100
  `PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root` fixture (confirmed to have both
  `Run3TLA_rebinned/postfit` and `Run3TLA_rebinned/data` -
  `run_masking.py`'s own hardcoded flag values), and asserts the exact,
  deterministic result (`seed=666` is fixed): `MaskMin=595.0`,
  `MaskMax=691.0`, `BlindRange="595,691"`, `pyBHresult` present, both
  plot files created. Confirmed deterministic by running the real script
  twice independently before writing this assertion.

### A real environment finding, verified and documented, not fixed

While writing the whole-script test, found that
`python/FindBHWindow.py`'s own production interpreter,
`pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3`, is broken in this environment: its
`pyvenv.cfg` sets `include-system-site-packages = false`, and neither
`uproot` nor `matplotlib` was ever installed into its own
`site-packages` (only `pyBumpHunter` itself, as an egg) -
`pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3 -c "import uproot"` fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError` before even reaching `pyBumpHunter`'s own import.
This means `run_masking.py`'s real subprocess command cannot run at all
in this environment. Pre-existing, not caused by this chunk, out of
scope to fix (mirrors `createBinning.py`'s missing-`resolutionFits.root`
gap) - `run_masking.py`'s call site is untouched.

Found and verified a working alternative instead: the ambient `python`
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` already puts on `PATH` (the same
LCG_102a interpreter `test_plot_post_fit.py`'s real-ROOT tests use) has
`numpy`/`matplotlib`/`uproot` all genuinely importable. It resolves
`pyBumpHunter` to this repository's own top-level submodule directory as
an empty namespace package (`BH.__file__ is None`,
`hasattr(BH, "BumpHunter1D") is False`) unless the submodule's own
package directory is explicitly **appended** to the *existing*
`PYTHONPATH` (replacing it was tried first and broke `matplotlib`, since
the LCG view's own setup already populates `PYTHONPATH` with the entries
`matplotlib`/`uproot` resolve from). With that append, all four
dependencies resolve correctly together - no new package installs, no
production-code change. This becomes this chunk's real-proof mechanism,
documented in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 14 alongside this
entry.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file is modified. `python/FindBHWindow.py` is unchanged
byte-for-byte in this diff - confirmed with `git diff --stat` (only
`tests/test_find_bh_window.py`, this activity-log entry, and
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s documentation of the environment finding
above appear).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_find_bh_window.py -v` -> **5 passed,
  20.48s** (4 fast/unmarked NpEncoder tests, 1 real end-to-end test using
  the working ambient-interpreter combination).
- `python -m ruff check` / `python -m black --check` on the new test
  file: clean (one line-length finding fixed via Black before this
  commit).
- `git diff --stat` (before staging): `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` and
  the new test file only - no production file touched.
- `git status --short` after the real-fixture test run: clean - the
  probe's `cd` into `tmp_path` before invoking the script kept
  `bump.png`/`BH_statistics.png` out of the repository entirely.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

- [x] Base commit for these tests: this branch's tip immediately before
  this commit (`9727e28`) - `python/FindBHWindow.py` is unchanged from
  its state there.
- [x] Every new test asserts a real output (exact serialized values for
  `NpEncoder`; exact deterministic `MaskMin`/`MaskMax`/`BlindRange` and
  real plot-file creation for the end-to-end test), not merely "does not
  raise."
- [x] `git diff --stat` shows no production file touched.
- [x] The tests were run for real, twice for the end-to-end case (once
  manually to confirm determinism before writing the assertion, once as
  the committed test itself), and reviewed directly.
- [x] Human-verification checkpoint: reviewed and confirmed in this same
  session before Step B's commit follows.

## Chunk 14.B — Extract python/FindBHWindow.py into named functions

### Objective

Move the whole-script logic characterized in Step A (commit `604b5cd`)
into named, individually-tested functions, deferring the heavy
third-party imports each needs, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 14.

### What changed

- `python/FindBHWindow.py` restructured into `NpEncoder` (unchanged),
  `parse_args(argv=None)`, `load_histograms(input_file, bkghist,
  datahist)`, `crop_data_to_background_range(bins, bins_data, data)`,
  `run_bump_hunter(data, bkg, bins)`, `save_bump_plots(hunter, data,
  bkg)`, `compute_mask_window(state, bins, firstbindata,
  use_bin_numbers)`, `write_mask_window_json(out_dict, outputjson)`,
  and `main(argv=None)` as the orchestrator.
- `import matplotlib`/`matplotlib.pyplot` deferred into
  `save_bump_plots()`; `import uproot` into `load_histograms()`;
  `from datetime import datetime` and `import pyBumpHunter as BH`
  into `run_bump_hunter()`. `import numpy as np` stays module-level
  (`NpEncoder` needs it as a name at call time; the two other "pure"
  functions never reference `np.` directly, only operate on values
  already numpy-typed by their caller).
- Confirmed-dead `import re, os` (from the original `import sys, re, os,
  argparse` line) removed - `grep -n "\bre\.\|\bos\."
  python/FindBHWindow.py` found zero uses of either in the whole file,
  confirmed before removing, matching the same explicit,
  separately-noted-removal precedent this plan already established.
- **Two real deviations from the plan's original target-functions table,
  found necessary by direct reading of the actual source (not
  discoverable from the table alone) and documented here rather than
  silently applied**:
  - `crop_data_to_background_range()` returns `(cropped_data,
    firstbindata)`, not just cropped data - `firstbindata` is also
    needed later, by `compute_mask_window()`'s `use_bin_numbers=True`
    branch. The plan's table only listed a cropped-values return.
  - `save_bump_plots()` takes `(hunter, data, bkg)`, not just `hunter` -
    `hunter.plot_bump()` needs `data`/`bkg` directly, not only the
    hunter object. The plan's table listed `save_bump_plots(bump_hunter)`
    only.
- `run_masking.py`'s call site (`pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3
  python/FindBHWindow.py ...`) is unchanged - confirmed via `grep -n
  "FindBHWindow" python/run_masking.py`.
- `tests/test_find_bh_window.py` gained 7 new tests: 3 for `parse_args()`,
  1 for `crop_data_to_background_range()` (plain Python lists - proven
  to need no real numpy call, only indexing/slicing), 2 for
  `compute_mask_window()` (one per `use_bin_numbers` branch, pinning
  both formulas independently), 1 for `write_mask_window_json()`
  (exercising `NpEncoder` end to end through a real file write). Step
  A's `NpEncoder` tests **dropped 3 of their 4 stubs** - an explicit,
  called-out exception to the Test Relocation Rule (no precedent for
  this in Chunks 0-13), since only `numpy` remains module-level
  post-extraction. Step A's end-to-end test kept unchanged, now
  exercising the extracted `main()`.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: `python/FindBHWindow.py` and
  `tests/test_find_bh_window.py` registered in
  `python_targets`/`test_targets`.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`run_masking.py`'s call site is byte-for-byte unchanged (confirmed by
grep). The extracted script was run for real, exactly as
`run_masking.py` invokes it (using this chunk's own working
ambient-interpreter combination, per Step A), against the real J100
fixture, and produced the identical deterministic result already
verified in Step A (`MaskMin=595.0`, `MaskMax=691.0`,
`BlindRange="595,691"`). The integration-gate rerun below confirms zero
regression to the real J100/J50 workflows, though - as already stated in
Chunk 14's own plan text - that gate never exercises this file's real
behavior at all (both committed fixtures are unmasked); the real proof
is the 12 passing tests above, particularly the deterministic real-run
one.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_find_bh_window.py -v` -> **12 passed,
  20.12s** (11 fast/unmarked in well under a second, 1 real end-to-end
  in the remainder).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **191 passed, 12
  deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean (33 files unchanged), exit code
  0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` -> **1 passed, 2 deselected,
  162.50 seconds, exit code 0**.
- `grep -n "FindBHWindow" python/run_masking.py`: confirms the call site
  is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- `git status --short` after every real-fixture test run: clean - no
  `bump.png`/`BH_statistics.png` left in the repository.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)

- [x] Step A's commit (`604b5cd`) named above; this commit's relocated
  end-to-end test is unchanged from it, per the Test Relocation Rule;
  the `NpEncoder` tests' stub-drop is the one explicit, documented
  exception to that rule.
- [x] No scientific constant, reference, tolerance, dependency revision,
  or canonical workflow argument touched.
- [x] Every newly-introduced function has a dedicated, genuinely new
  test (not copied from Step A).
- [x] `run_masking.py` still invokes `python/FindBHWindow.py` by the
  same subprocess command - confirmed by grep, not assumed.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] This entry names Chunk 14 as now resolved; Chunks 15-18 remain
  explicitly open.

## Chunk 15.A — Characterization tests for python/ExtractFitParameters.py

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of
`python/ExtractFitParameters.py` (a 109-line script: one class,
`FitParameterExtractor`, whose `Extract()` — 42 lines — does the entire
real workflow, plus a thin `main()`) before Chunk 15's Step B, which
adds no new decomposition — this is the honest minimal-decomposition
case stated in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 15's own Rationale.

### Target functions/classes — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)

| Unit | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FitParameterExtractor.__init__(self, wsfile)` | `wsfile: str` (in production, the fit-result file, despite the name — see below) | — | none |
| `Extract(self)` | — | populates `h1_params`/`h2_cov`/`h2_cor`/`nsig`/`nsigErr` | opens `wsfile`, reads the `fitResult` `RooFitResult` |
| `GetH1Params`/`GetH2Cov`/`GetH2Cor`/`GetNsig`/`GetNsigErr` | — | ROOT-typed values | lazily call `self.Extract()` if the corresponding attribute is falsy |
| `WriteRoot(self, outfile)` | `outfile: str` | — | writes the three histograms to a new file |

### Tests added

- `test_extract_and_accessors_and_writeroot_against_real_fixture` — real
  ROOT, constructs `FitParameterExtractor` against the already-committed
  `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
  (exactly what `run_fit.py:168` passes as `wsfile` in production — the
  lowest fixture-sourcing risk of all five files in this plan, no
  synthetic fixture needed), calls `Extract()`, all 5 accessors, and
  `WriteRoot(tmp_path/"out.root")`, then re-opens that output file and
  asserts its three histograms are genuinely non-empty.
- `test_getnsig_and_getnsigerr_refire_extract_when_zero` /
  `_do_not_refire_extract_when_nonzero` — fast tests (no real ROOT call),
  stubbing `sys.modules["ROOT"]` with a trivial empty `ModuleType` purely
  so the module-level `import ROOT`/`from ROOT import *` resolves. Pin
  down the `if not self.nsig:` / `if not self.nsigErr:` falsiness quirk
  exactly as it exists today (preserve, not fix — matching Chunk 5's own
  precedent): a falsy (zero) cached value re-triggers `Extract()` on
  every single call; a truthy (non-zero) one does not.

### A real finding from the real fixture, characterized not assumed

The committed fixture is a bkg-only fit
(`FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`) — confirmed directly by dumping
`floatParsFinal()`: its six parameters are `nbkg`/`p2`/`p3`/`p4`/`p5`/
`p6`, none containing the substring `"nsig"`. `GetNsig()`/`GetNsigErr()`
therefore genuinely return `None` against this real fixture, not a gap
in the test — asserted as the real observed behavior.

### Documented, not fixed: the shared `wsfile` name

`ExtractFitParameters.FitParameterExtractor`'s `wsfile` parameter and
`ExtractPostfitFromWS.PostfitExtractor`'s same-named parameter mean the
same thing in production (both receive the fit-result file, never the
workspace file either name suggests). Recorded here and will be recorded
again in Chunk 18's Known Limitations; not renamed, per Chunk 15's own
plan text.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file is modified. `python/ExtractFitParameters.py` is
unchanged byte-for-byte in this diff — confirmed with `git diff --stat`
(only `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py` and this activity-log entry
appear).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py -v -m "not
  requires_analysis_dependencies"` -> **2 passed**.
- Under `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py -v -m
  "requires_root and requires_analysis_dependencies"` -> **1 passed,
  4.61s**.
- Full lightweight suite (`pytest -m "not requires_analysis_dependencies"
  tests/`): **194 passed, 15 deselected** (was 192 passed, 14 deselected
  immediately before this commit — +2 fast, +1 deselected, matching this
  file's 3 new tests exactly).
- `python -m ruff check` / `python -m black --check` on the new test
  file: clean (one formatting fix applied via Black before this commit).
- `git diff --stat` (before staging): the new test file and this
  activity-log entry only — no production file touched.
- `git status --short`: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

- [x] Base commit for these tests: this branch's tip immediately before
  this commit (`058243b`) — `python/ExtractFitParameters.py` is
  unchanged from its state there.
- [x] Every new test asserts a real output (non-empty histograms and a
  real written file for the end-to-end test; exact call-count behavior
  for the falsiness-quirk tests), not merely "does not raise."
- [x] `git diff --stat` shows no production file touched.
- [x] The end-to-end test was run for real against the real committed
  fixture and reviewed directly; its unexpected-but-real `nsig is None`
  result was investigated (by dumping `floatParsFinal()` directly) rather
  than assumed away.
- [x] Human-verification checkpoint: reviewed and confirmed in this same
  session before Step B's commit follows.

## Chunk 15.B — Register python/ExtractFitParameters.py (no restructuring)

### Objective

Complete Chunk 15 per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s own explicit
Rationale: `Extract()` (42 lines) is one cohesive block, and forcing a
3-way split would relocate, not reduce, its complexity, unlike Chunk
16's genuinely tangled 137-line `Extract()`. This chunk's entire value
is the file's first-ever direct test of its real behavior (Step A,
commit `f17de07`) plus registration — no production-code restructuring
is proposed or performed.

### What changed

- `python/ExtractFitParameters.py`: **unchanged, byte-for-byte** —
  confirmed via `git diff python/ExtractFitParameters.py` returning
  empty immediately before this commit. Step A's tests already exercise
  the file's real, existing structure directly; nothing in Step A's
  tests required any restructuring to pass.
- `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py`: no change needed — Step A
  already wrote its tests directly into this chunk's final file name (no
  interim characterization-only filename existed to move from, unlike
  Chunks 13/14's Test Relocation Rule), matching this chunk's
  no-decomposition design.
- `scripts/quality_check.py`: `python/ExtractFitParameters.py` and
  `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py` registered in
  `python_targets`/`test_targets` (inserted alphabetically:
  `createBinning.py` < `ExtractFitParameters.py` < `FindBHWindow.py`
  case-insensitively; same ordering for the paired test file).

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`python/ExtractFitParameters.py` is byte-for-byte unchanged, so there is
no extracted code path to re-verify beyond what Step A's real-fixture
test already exercises directly (`Extract()`, all 5 accessors,
`WriteRoot()`, against the real, already-committed
`FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`). `run_fit.py`'s call site
(`fpe = FitParameterExtractor(wsfile=fitresultfile)` at line 168) is
untouched — confirmed by `git diff python/run_fit.py` returning empty.

### Verification performed

- `git diff python/ExtractFitParameters.py`: empty, confirming no
  production restructuring occurred.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py -v` -> **3
  passed** (2 fast, 1 real-ROOT end-to-end, run together under the
  ambient interpreter from `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> lightweight suite
  **194 passed, 15 deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` (mandatory scientific gate,
  unchanged canonical J100/J50 workflows) -> **1 passed, 2 deselected,
  135.10s, exit code 0**.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `git status --short` after all real-fixture runs: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)

- [x] Step A's commit (`f17de07`) named above; no test relocation was
  needed (Step A's tests already live in the chunk's final file).
- [x] No scientific constant, reference, tolerance, dependency revision,
  or canonical workflow argument touched.
- [x] No new function was introduced (this chunk's own Rationale states
  why), so there is no new-function-needs-a-new-test obligation beyond
  what Step A already added.
- [x] `run_fit.py` still constructs `FitParameterExtractor` the same
  way — confirmed by `git diff python/run_fit.py` returning empty.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] This entry names Chunk 15 as now resolved; Chunks 16 (+ optional
  16a/16b), 17, and 18 remain explicitly open.

## Fix ruff/black findings on python/ExtractFitParameters.py (CI, Chunk 15 follow-up)

### Objective

CI's `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` failed after Chunk
15.B (`f0745ff`) registered `python/ExtractFitParameters.py` in
`python_targets`: 26 pre-existing Ruff findings (18 auto-fixable) that
had never been surfaced before, because this file was never linted
until this chunk registered it — Chunk 15's own Rationale explicitly
left the file byte-for-byte unchanged, so these findings were never
seen locally against the exact target list CI runs. A real gap in this
chunk's own verification: the local Step B check ran Ruff/Black only
against the new test file and `scripts/quality_check.py`, not against
`python/ExtractFitParameters.py` itself once it joined the registered
target list.

### What changed

- `import ROOT` / `import sys, re, os, math, argparse` / `from ROOT
  import *` (three lines, one wildcard import, one combined import)
  replaced with individually-sorted `import argparse` / `import sys` /
  `import ROOT` — confirmed dead via `ruff`'s own F401 findings: `re`,
  `os`, and `math` are unused anywhere in the file (matches the same
  explicit, separately-noted dead-import-removal precedent already
  established for `python/FindBHWindow.py`'s dead `re`/`os` in Chunk
  14.B).
- `from ROOT import *`'s two wildcard-resolved names, `TH1D`/`TH2D`
  (3 call sites), rewritten to explicit `ROOT.TH1D`/`ROOT.TH2D` —
  behavior-identical (the wildcard import made these names aliases of
  the same `ROOT` module attributes; `ROOT` was already imported
  separately and used elsewhere in the same method), and resolves
  Ruff's F403/F405 (undetectable-star-import) findings, which are not
  auto-fixable.
- Two long `argparse.add_argument(...)` calls and the two `TH2D(...)`
  calls wrapped across multiple lines (Ruff E501, line length) —
  formatting only, no argument values changed.
- All whitespace findings (`W291`/`W293` — trailing whitespace, blank
  lines containing whitespace) and import sorting (`I001`/`E401`)
  applied via `ruff check --fix` then `black`, both purely mechanical.
- No other line changed: no method signature, no control flow, no
  attribute name, no default value, no accessor logic touched.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

Re-ran the real-ROOT end-to-end test
(`test_extract_and_accessors_and_writeroot_against_real_fixture`)
against this now-reformatted file — still **1 passed** — confirming
`ROOT.TH1D`/`ROOT.TH2D` produce identical output to the previous
wildcard-imported `TH1D`/`TH2D` names. `run_fit.py`'s call site is
untouched (this commit only touches
`python/ExtractFitParameters.py`/`doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py -v -m "not
  requires_analysis_dependencies"` -> **2 passed**.
- Under `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py -v -m
  "requires_root and requires_analysis_dependencies"` -> **1 passed,
  4.24s**.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **193 passed, 13
  deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean (35 files unchanged), exit
  code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` (mandatory scientific gate) ->
  **1 passed, 2 deselected, 137.00s, exit code 0**.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, general fix variant)

- [x] Root cause identified and stated explicitly (registration without
  linting the newly-registered production file itself).
- [x] Every change is either a confirmed-dead-import removal (matching
  established precedent) or a behavior-identical rewrite
  (`ROOT.TH1D`/`ROOT.TH2D` vs. wildcard-imported `TH1D`/`TH2D`) or pure
  formatting — no method signature, control flow, or numeric value
  changed.
- [x] Real-ROOT test re-run and passed against the reformatted file.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).

## Materialize the two broken AnaWSBuilder.dtd fixture symlinks

### Objective

Fix a real, pre-existing, previously-undetected CI failure surfaced for
the first time by this session's own earlier CI fix (`6855d4a`, "Wire
the ROOT regression tests into CI"): before that commit,
`tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py` — marked `requires_analysis_dependencies`
— had never actually been executed by any CI job since it was created
in Chunk 11.A/11.B, so its failure had stayed invisible.

### Root cause

`run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/AnaWSBuilder.dtd` and
`run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/AnaWSBuilder.dtd` were git-tracked
**symlinks** (mode `120000`) pointing to an absolute path on this
specific AFS-mounted machine:
`/afs/cern.ch/user/h/hhook/FrequentistFramework/config/dijetisrTLA/AnaWSBuilder.dtd`.
This is exactly what `python/run_templates.py:140` creates at runtime
(`ln -sf `realpath config/dijetisrTLA/AnaWSBuilder.dtd` ...`) — genuine,
intentional behavior for a live run on this machine, that happened to be
captured verbatim when these fixture directories were committed. In
GitHub Actions (no AFS mount, no such path), `shutil.copytree()` inside
`test_plot_postfit_macro.py` fails trying to resolve the broken symlink,
producing the `shutil.Error` observed in CI.

Confirmed via the GitHub API that this specific check has been failing
since `6855d4a` first ran it — every commit before that (including
Chunk 11's own `b026efd`/`ea824a7`) shows CI "success" only because the
test was never selected/run at all, not because it ever passed for
real.

### What changed

- Both symlinks replaced with plain regular files (git `T` /
  typechange), mode `100755` matching the source file's own tracked
  mode. Content confirmed byte-identical to
  `config/dijetisrTLA/AnaWSBuilder.dtd` via `sha1sum` before and after
  the change (`90cf5e852fc3288f01239d231ddfb49d7df472f1` in all three
  locations).
- `python/run_templates.py`'s own runtime symlink-creation logic
  (`ln -sf `realpath ...``) is completely untouched — this fix only
  touches the two already-committed fixture copies, making them
  self-contained/portable, not the live-run behavior that creates
  fresh symlinks in a real fit's own output directory.
- Confirmed via grep that no test or production code checks
  `os.path.islink()`/`os.readlink()` on this path anywhere in the
  repository — nothing depends on it being a symlink specifically, only
  on the DTD content being present and readable.
- `git add -f` was required: `.gitignore`'s `run/**` blanket-ignore only
  explicitly re-includes `analysis_results.json` for these two fixture
  directories, not `AnaWSBuilder.dtd` — these files were originally
  force-added, and re-adding them after `git rm` needed the same `-f`.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

This is a fixture-portability fix, not a scientific-content change — the
DTD content is byte-identical to what was already being read (via the
symlink) on this machine. `python/run_templates.py`'s real, live
symlink-creation call site is untouched.

### Verification performed

- `diff config/dijetisrTLA/AnaWSBuilder.dtd
  run/fits/{J100/run_481_3000_sixPar,J50/run_344_2079_sixPar}/AnaWSBuilder.dtd`:
  identical in both cases.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py
  tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py
  -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v` -> **6 passed, 5 deselected,
  38.08s** — including
  `test_plot_postfit_macro_produces_nonempty_pdf_for_real_fixture`,
  which was the test failing in CI.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **193 passed, 13
  deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean (35 files unchanged), exit code
  0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` (mandatory scientific gate) ->
  **1 passed, 2 deselected, 145.94s, exit code 0**.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, general fix variant)

- [x] Root cause identified with direct evidence (GitHub API check-run
  history across multiple prior commits), not assumed.
- [x] Fix is minimal and content-preserving: same bytes, same mode
  family (executable), only the git object type changed
  (symlink -> regular file).
- [x] No production code touched — confirmed via `git diff --stat`
  showing only the two fixture files and this activity-log entry.
- [x] Real-ROOT test that was failing in CI re-run locally and
  confirmed passing.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).

### 2026-09-04: Mandatory git-native pre-commit gate

#### Objective

At the user's explicit request ("i would like a way to have a mandatory
check of the analysis and linting before a document is allowed to be
commited"), add a mechanism that blocks a local `git commit` unless the
lightweight quality gate passes, and — when the ROOT-dependent
scientific runtime is actually available locally — the mandatory J100/
J50 scientific integration gate too. Clarified with the user beforehand
(AskUserQuestion) that the integration gate should run whenever
available and be skipped, not block, when it isn't (e.g. no CVMFS
mount) — this was chosen over always-mandatory (would hard-block
commits on any machine without CVMFS) and over lint-only (would miss
scientific regressions locally, catching them only in CI).

#### Reconciling with the existing Tier-2 pre-commit policy

`doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` already documents a deliberate policy: the
third-party `pre-commit` framework (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) is
optional, unpinned, and not required — with a machine-verifiable test
(`test_precommit_is_not_a_locked_development_dependency`) confirming
the `pre-commit` PyPI package is absent from both dependency manifests.
This new mechanism is a **different thing that happens to share a
name**: a plain git-native hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`), not the
third-party framework, adding no new dependency and requiring no
pinned version — it simply wires the two commands already authoritative
elsewhere in this repository (`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode
full`, and the same `"integration and requires_root"` scientific gate
every Tier 3 chunk runs before committing) into a mandatory local
check. `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s "Optional pre-commit configuration"
section now has a new subsection making this distinction explicit,
rather than silently appearing to reverse the existing policy.

#### What changed

- `.githooks/pre-commit` (new): runs `python scripts/quality_check.py
  --mode full` unconditionally (blocks on failure); then attempts
  `source scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` in a login-shell subshell — if
  it succeeds (CVMFS/ROOT genuinely available here), also runs `python
  -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` and blocks on failure; if setup
  fails, prints the setup failure output as a warning and skips the
  scientific half without blocking the commit (still runs in CI).
  Prefers `.venv/bin/python` when present, matching this repository's
  own documented dev-environment convention.
- `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh` (new): one-time-per-checkout installer
  — `chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit` and `git config core.hooksPath
  .githooks`. Run once locally in this checkout as part of this change.
- `tests/test_repo_utils.py`: new
  `test_git_hook_pre_commit_gate_matches_authoritative_commands`,
  matching the existing policy-test pattern
  (`test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate`,
  `test_precommit_is_not_a_locked_development_dependency`) — pins that
  the hook and its installer exist, are executable, and reference the
  exact authoritative commands, not the wording of a human-readable
  doc.
- `README.md`: new "Mandatory pre-commit gate" subsection under
  "Tier 1 and Tier 2 validation", pointing at the installer and noting
  the `--no-verify` bypass and its limits (CI still runs the same
  gates).
- `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`: new subsection under "Optional pre-commit
  configuration" documenting the distinction above.

#### Verification performed

- Ran `.githooks/pre-commit` directly against a clean staged state:
  lightweight gate passed, ROOT runtime detected, scientific
  integration gate ran and **passed (1 passed, 2 deselected, 143.45s)**,
  hook exited 0.
- Deliberately introduced a trailing-whitespace Ruff violation and
  re-ran the hook directly: **blocked correctly (exit 1)**, printed the
  Ruff finding, reverted the test change afterward.
- Repeated the same deliberate-violation test through a **real `git
  commit`** (not just direct script invocation), confirming
  `core.hooksPath` wiring actually intercepts commits: `git commit`
  exited 1, no commit was created, `git reset --hard HEAD` confirmed a
  clean working tree afterward.
- `shellcheck .githooks/pre-commit scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`:
  clean (one style finding, SC2002 "useless cat", fixed before this
  check).
- `bash -n` syntax check on both scripts: clean.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **194 passed, 13
  deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean (35 files unchanged), exit code
  0.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- Installed locally in this checkout: `git config --get
  core.hooksPath` -> `.githooks`.

#### Compliance review

- [x] No new Python dependency added; `pre-commit==` still absent from
  both `requirements-dev.txt` and `requirements-dev-lock.txt` (the
  existing policy test for this still passes).
- [x] Existing Tier-2 "optional pre-commit framework" policy is
  preserved verbatim, not silently reversed — the new mechanism is
  explicitly distinguished from it in both `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` and
  the hook script's own header comment.
- [x] Both the blocking path and the passing path were exercised for
  real, including through an actual `git commit` invocation, not just
  read.
- [x] No production analysis code touched.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).

## Chunk 16.A — Characterization tests for python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py

### Objective

Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of
`python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` (137-line `Extract()`, the single
largest method across all nine files this plan touches) before Chunk
16's Step B extraction, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 16 —
including its two currently-dormant bugs, pinned exactly as they exist
today so Step B cannot accidentally "clean them up" (Chunk 5's own
precedent).

### A real correction to the plan, found before writing this chunk's tests

While designing this chunk's assertions, ran the real extractor once
against the fixture below and found the plan's own design table
undercounted the accessors affected by the key-vs-value fallback bug:
it listed 5 (`GetNbins`/`GetNpars`/`GetH1Chi2`/`GetH1Postfit`/
`GetH1Residuals`), omitting `GetNdof`, which has the byte-identical
`next(iter(self.channel_ndof))` pattern — confirmed by direct source
reading (`grep -n "GetNdof" python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`) and by a
real `.GetNdof()` call returning `'Run3TLA'` (a channel-name string)
instead of `2513` (the real ndof value). `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 16 and Chunk 16b corrected in place ("5" → "6" throughout, the
omitted accessor named explicitly) before this chunk's tests were
written against the corrected list.

### Target functions/classes — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)

| Unit | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getNPars(pdf, obs, exclSyst)` | real RooFit objects | int | none |
| `expHist(h)` | a `TH1` | — | mutates `h` in place |
| `getChi2(extractor, channelname, npars, useSumW2=False)` | a `PostfitExtractor` instance + args | — | **mutates the passed `extractor`'s `channel_chi2`/`channel_nbins`/`channel_npars`/`channel_ndof`/`channel_pval`/`channel_hresiduals`/`channel_hchi2` dicts directly** |
| `PostfitExtractor.Extract(self)` | — | populates 8 per-channel dicts across up to 4 real categories per run (base/bkgonly/rebinned/bkgonly\_rebinned) | opens `wsfile`/`datafile`/`rebinfile`, calls `getChi2` once per category |
| `GetChi2`/`GetNbins`/`GetNpars`/`GetNdof`/`GetPval`/`GetH1Chi2`/`GetH1Postfit`/`GetH1Residuals` | optional `channelname` | real value (with `channelname`); **6 of 8 return a channel-name string instead of the real value when `channelname` is omitted** (`GetChi2`/`GetPval` are the two that correctly return the real value) | lazily call `self.Extract()` if not yet run |
| `WriteRoot(self, outfile, dirPerCategory=False)` | — | writes categorized histograms | `dirPerCategory=True` (the only branch `run_fit.py` ever calls) writes one directory per real category |

### Tests added

- `test_extract_and_accessors_characterize_todays_real_and_buggy_behavior`
  — real ROOT, constructs `PostfitExtractor` against the already-committed
  `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
  as `wsfile` (confirmed directly: this single file contains both the
  `fitResult` `RooFitResult` Chunk 15 reads and the `combWS`
  `RooWorkspace`/`ModelConfig` this file reads), the committed J100
  `datafile`/`datahist`, and the committed
  `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/mjjResolutionBinning_481.root` as `rebinfile`
  — matching `run_fit.py:130–166` exactly, no synthetic fixture needed
  for any of the three. Calls `Extract()`, asserts the real 4-category
  list (`Run3TLA`/`Run3TLA_bkgonly`/`Run3TLA_rebinned`/
  `Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned`), asserts `getChi2()`'s real mutation of
  `channel_chi2`/`channel_nbins`/`channel_npars`/`channel_ndof`/
  `channel_pval`/`channel_hresiduals`/`channel_hchi2`, asserts all 8
  accessors' no-`channelname` fallback (2 correct, 6 buggy — pinned
  exactly as observed), and asserts the same 6 accessors return the
  real value when `channelname` is supplied (proving the bug is
  specific to the omitted-argument fallback, the call shape
  `run_fit.py` never uses).
- `test_writeroot_dirpercategory_true_produces_expected_output_for_real_fixture`
  — the same fixtures, calls `WriteRoot(tmp_path/"out.root",
  dirPerCategory=True)` (the only branch `run_fit.py:165` ever calls)
  and verifies all 4 categories' `data`/`postfit`/`residuals`/`chi2`
  keys are present and non-empty in the output file.
  `dirPerCategory=False` is Chunk 16a's own, separately-scoped concern
  (a real Python-3 `TypeError` today).

Both real-ROOT determinism-checked before writing assertions: ran the
same construction twice independently, confirmed bit-identical
`chi2`/`pval`/`nbins`/`npars`/`ndof` values before hardcoding them.

### A real bug in the test itself, found and fixed before this commit

The first draft used `pytest.approx(...)` for float comparisons inside
the bare `python - <<'INNER_PY'` subprocess snippet — but `pytest` is
never imported there (it runs under the ambient LCG interpreter as a
standalone script, not inside this test process), so the snippet raised
`NameError: name 'pytest' is not defined`. Fixed by replacing
`pytest.approx()` with a small manual-tolerance `approx()` helper
defined inline in the snippet itself. Caught by actually running the
test against real ROOT before considering Step A done, not assumed
correct from a syntax read.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file is modified. `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` is
unchanged byte-for-byte in this diff — confirmed with `git diff --stat`
(only `tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py`,
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s accessor-count correction, and this
activity-log entry appear).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py -v -m "not
  requires_analysis_dependencies"` -> **0 selected, 2 deselected**
  (every test in this file needs real ROOT — no ROOT-free fragment
  exists anywhere in this module, unlike `createBinning.py`/
  `FindBHWindow.py`).
- Under `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py -v -m
  "requires_root and requires_analysis_dependencies"` -> **2 passed,
  67.21s** (after fixing the `pytest.approx` bug above; the first
  attempt failed for that reason, not a real defect in the
  characterization itself).
- Full lightweight suite: **195 passed, 17 deselected** (was 194/15
  before this commit — +0 fast, +2 deselected, matching this file's 2
  new tests, both real-ROOT-only).
- Ruff/Black clean on the new test file.
- `git status --short` after both real-fixture test runs: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

- [x] Base commit for these tests: this branch's tip immediately before
  this commit (`9d7d1d0`) — `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` is
  unchanged from its state there.
- [x] Every new test asserts a real output (real category names, real
  populated dict state, real accessor return values — both the correct
  and the buggy ones — real non-empty output-file content), not merely
  "does not raise."
- [x] Both of today's dormant bugs pinned exactly as observed, including
  the accessor-count correction (6, not 5) found and verified before
  writing the tests, not silently absorbed without comment.
- [x] `git diff --stat` shows no production file touched.
- [x] The tests were run for real, twice (once revealing the
  `pytest.approx` bug, once confirming the fix), and reviewed directly.
- [x] Human-verification checkpoint: reviewed and confirmed in this same
  session before Step B's commit follows.

## Chunk 16.B — Extract python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py into named helpers

### Objective

Decompose `Extract()` (137 lines, the largest method across all nine
files this plan touches) into four private helper methods, per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 16, with `Extract()` becoming the
orchestrator. `getNPars`/`expHist`/`getChi2` stay free functions,
unchanged; `WriteRoot()`/the 8 accessors/`GetCategories()` stay
undecomposed one-liners, unchanged — matching the plan's own scope
exactly.

### What changed

- `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` restructured: `Extract()` now calls
  `_open_workspace_and_data(self)` (opens `wsfile`/`datafile`, builds
  `w`/`pdf`/`cat`/`data`/`dataList`/`nChan`, sets `self.h_data`),
  `_build_channel_postfit_histogram(self, pdfi, x, channelname, npars,
  data)` (builds the main postfit histogram, populates
  `channel_hdata`/`channel_hpostfit`, calls `getChi2`), conditionally
  `_build_bkgonly_variant(self, w, channelname, x, hpdf, nBins,
  binEdges, npars)` (builds the bkg-only variant, calls `getChi2`
  again), and `_apply_external_rebinning(self, channelname,
  channelname_bkg, npars)` (both the main and, if `bkgonly`, the
  bkg-only rebinned variants, calling `getChi2` for each) — the exact
  call shape and per-channel loop structure preserved unchanged.
- Confirmed-dead `import json` (per the plan's own grep finding, `json.`
  has no hits beyond the import line) removed, explicitly noted here
  rather than silently dropped. Also removed: dead `re`/`os` (confirmed
  via `grep -n '\bre\.\|\bos\.'`, zero hits for either), matching the
  same dead-import precedent already established for
  `FindBHWindow.py`/`ExtractFitParameters.py`.
- `import sys, re, os, math, argparse` split into individually-sorted
  imports; `from ROOT import *` removed, its three resolved names
  (`TH1D`, `RooArgSet`, `RooStats`) rewritten to explicit
  `ROOT.TH1D`/`ROOT.RooArgSet`/`ROOT.RooStats` — behavior-identical,
  same reasoning already verified for `ExtractFitParameters.py`'s own
  follow-up lint fix. Done proactively in this same commit, not a
  separate follow-up: having just fixed the CI gap this exact omission
  caused for Chunk 15, this chunk's own newly-registered production
  file was linted and fixed *before* committing, not after a CI
  failure.
- **Two real, pre-existing quirks preserved verbatim, not "cleaned up"
  by the refactor** — caught by close reading while extracting, not
  silently carried over unnoticed:
  - The `try: hpdf.Scale(...) except: pass` bare-except blocks (both the
    main-channel and bkgonly-channel Scale calls) keep their bare
    `except:` exactly as written, with `# noqa: E722` added rather than
    "fixing" the style finding into `except Exception:` — a genuine
    behavior difference (bare `except` also catches
    `SystemExit`/`KeyboardInterrupt`/`GeneratorExit`) that this
    extraction must not introduce. (Caught during this chunk's own
    work: the first draft of the extraction silently converted these to
    `except Exception:` to satisfy Ruff automatically — reverted before
    committing once noticed, per the "preserve quirks verbatim" rule.)
  - **A newly-found, real dormant bug in `_build_bkgonly_variant`**
    (pre-existing in the original script, not introduced by this
    extraction): its `try/except` block calls `hpdf.Scale(...)` — the
    **main** channel's already-fully-consumed histogram object — not
    `hpdf_bkg.Scale(...)` as the adjacent commented-out line
    (`# hpdf_bkg.Scale(expectedEvents_bkg/hpdf_bkg.Integral())`)
    suggests was intended. Because `hpdf`'s content was already copied
    into `h_postfit` earlier and is never read again, this typo means
    `hpdf_bkg` is in practice **never actually scaled** by
    `expectedEvents_bkg` — the bkg-only postfit histogram's
    normalization may not be what its neighboring comment implies.
    Preserved exactly as-is (out of scope for Chunk 16/16a/16b's
    explicitly-listed bugs), with an explicit code comment added at the
    call site pointing to this note and this activity-log entry — not
    silently fixed, not silently left uncommented either.
  - `pdf_bkg_unscaled`/`yield_bkg` (assigned via `w.obj(...)`, never
    read) preserved verbatim inside `_build_bkgonly_variant`, with
    `# noqa: F841` — not removed, since a `RooWorkspace.obj()` call may
    have a caching/registration side effect beyond its return value,
    and removing an unread-but-possibly-side-effecting call is exactly
    the kind of "fix" this plan's guardrails forbid absent a
    separately-scoped bug-fix chunk.

### Tests added

`tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py` gained 2 new tests (4 total,
all real-ROOT, all against the same committed J100 fixtures as Step A):
`test_open_workspace_and_data_returns_expected_handles` (calls
`_open_workspace_and_data()` directly, asserts the real returned handle
types/values and that `self.h_data` is populated) and
`test_build_channel_postfit_bkgonly_and_rebinning_helpers_populate_expected_state`
(manually unrolls `Extract()`'s own per-channel loop header, then calls
`_build_channel_postfit_histogram`/`_build_bkgonly_variant`/
`_apply_external_rebinning` directly in sequence, asserting each one's
own real return value and dict-population contract individually — not
merely re-observing `Extract()`'s already-tested combined result).
Step A's 2 tests (`Extract()`+accessors characterization, `WriteRoot()`
end-to-end) kept unchanged per the Test Relocation Rule — no move was
needed, Step A already wrote them into this chunk's final file name,
matching Chunk 15's own precedent.

### What this commit does NOT do

`WriteRoot()`'s `dirPerCategory=False` branch (Chunk 16a's own,
separately-scoped concern — a real Python-3 `TypeError` today) and the
6-of-8 accessors' key-vs-value fallback bug (Chunk 16b's own concern)
are both untouched. `run_fit.py`'s call site is confirmed unchanged via
`git diff python/run_fit.py` (empty).

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py -v` (under
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter) -> **4 passed,
  30.91s**.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **194 passed, 17
  deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean (**37 files unchanged** —
  confirming `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`'s own lint/format issues
  were fixed proactively in this same commit, not deferred to a
  follow-up), exit code 0.
- `git diff python/run_fit.py`: empty.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)

- [x] Step A's commit (`9dd0ccd`) named above; no test relocation was
  needed (Step A's tests already live in the chunk's final file).
- [x] No scientific constant, reference, tolerance, dependency revision,
  or canonical workflow argument touched.
- [x] Every newly-introduced function has a dedicated, genuinely new
  test exercising it directly (not copied from Step A).
- [x] `run_fit.py` still constructs `PostfitExtractor` the same way —
  confirmed by `git diff` returning empty.
- [x] Both of today's dormant bugs (the 6-accessor fallback, the
  `dirPerCategory=False` indexing) remain untouched, exactly as Step A
  characterized them; the newly-found `hpdf`-vs-`hpdf_bkg` Scale quirk
  is also preserved, documented in place and here, not fixed.
- [x] A real, unintentional behavior change caught and reverted before
  committing: the first draft's bare-`except:` -> `except Exception:`
  "cleanup," undone once noticed.
- [x] `scripts/quality_check.py` registration done in this same commit
  (guardrail 5), and the newly-registered production file's own lint
  findings fixed proactively, not left for a later CI failure.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] This entry names Chunk 16 as now resolved; optional Chunks
  16a/16b, Chunk 17, and Chunk 18 remain explicitly open.

## Chunk 16a.A — Characterize WriteRoot(dirPerCategory=False)'s crash

### Objective

Pin down, before fixing it, the exact real behavior of
`PostfitExtractor.WriteRoot(self, outfile, dirPerCategory=False)`'s
`else` branch today: `self.channel_hpostfit.values()[-1]` (and the two
other `.values()[-1]` calls beside it) is Python-2-only dict-values
indexing, which raises `TypeError` under Python 3. Per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 16a (optional, run only after
Chunk 16 lands, against the newly-decomposed structure — confirmed:
this test runs against `0732473`'s already-extracted `Extract()`).

Currently dead-in-practice: `run_fit.py:165` always calls `WriteRoot`
with `dirPerCategory=True`, so this branch has never executed in the
scientific gate, in CI, or (as far as this repository's history shows)
in any verified run — the same dormancy pattern already verified once
this session for `createBinning.py`'s syntax error.

### Test added

`test_writeroot_dirpercategory_false_currently_raises_typeerror` — real
ROOT, the same committed J100 fixtures as Chunk 16's own tests, calls
`Extract()` then `WriteRoot(<tmp file>, dirPerCategory=False)` and
asserts it raises `TypeError` today. Confirmed by actually running it:
**1 passed, 5.29s** — the crash is real, not hypothetical.

### What this commit does NOT do

No production file is modified. `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` is
unchanged byte-for-byte in this diff — confirmed with `git diff --stat`
(only `tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py` and this activity-log
entry appear).

### Verification performed

- Under `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter:
  `python -m pytest
  tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py::test_writeroot_dirpercategory_false_currently_raises_typeerror
  -v -m "requires_root and requires_analysis_dependencies"` -> **1
  passed, 5.29s**.
- Full lightweight suite: **195 passed, 20 deselected** — verified via
  a direct `git stash`/`git stash pop` before/after comparison against
  this branch's committed tip (`0732473`), which is **195 passed, 19
  deselected**: +0 fast, +1 deselected, exactly matching this commit's
  one new `requires_root`+`requires_analysis_dependencies`-marked test.
- `git diff --stat`: only the test file and this activity-log entry —
  no production file touched.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

- [x] Base commit for this test: this branch's tip immediately before
  this commit (`0732473`) — `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` is
  unchanged from its state there.
- [x] The new test asserts a real, observed outcome (`TypeError` is
  actually raised), not merely "does not raise."
- [x] `git diff --stat` shows no production file touched.
- [x] The test was run for real and reviewed directly before this
  commit.
- [x] Human-verification checkpoint: reviewed and confirmed in this
  same session before Step B's commit (the actual fix) follows.

## Chunk 16a.B — Fix WriteRoot(dirPerCategory=False)'s Python-2 indexing

### Objective

Fix the real, characterized crash from Step A (commit `caa33e6`):
`self.channel_hpostfit.values()[-1]` (and the two other `.values()[-1]`
calls beside it, on `channel_hresiduals`/`channel_hchi2`) is Python-2-only
dict-values indexing, raising `TypeError` under Python 3. Per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 16a — optional, scoped to this one
bug only, run after Chunk 16 (`0732473`) landed against the
already-decomposed structure.

### What changed

- `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`'s `WriteRoot(self, outfile,
  dirPerCategory=False)`: all three `.values()[-1]` calls in the
  `dirPerCategory=False` branch changed to `list(...values())[-1]` —
  the Python-3-correct equivalent of the original Python-2 indexing.
  Confirmed directly (not assumed from reading the source) which
  channel this selects: `channel_hpostfit`/`channel_hresiduals`/
  `channel_hchi2` are all populated in the exact same insertion order
  `Extract()` builds them (base channel, bkgonly variant, rebinned
  variant, bkgonly\_rebinned variant), so `list(...)[-1]` selects
  `"Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned"` against this fixture — the *same*
  "last" convention the branch's own comment and the `dirPerCategory=
  True` branch's category iteration both already implied, not changed
  to "first" despite the (pre-existing, inconsistent, untouched)
  comment saying "just take first (and hopefully only) channel."
  A short code comment added at the fix site pointing to this entry.

### Test updated

`tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py`'s
`test_writeroot_dirpercategory_false_currently_raises_typeerror`
replaced with
`test_writeroot_dirpercategory_false_now_matches_last_category_content`:
writes both `dirPerCategory=False` and `dirPerCategory=True` outputs
from the same extractor, then asserts the `False` branch's top-level
`postfit`/`residuals`/`chi2` histograms are bin-for-bin identical to
the `True` branch's `Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned` directory's same three
histograms — proving the fix produces the *same real content*, not
merely that it no longer crashes.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

`dirPerCategory=False` remains dead-in-practice: `run_fit.py:165`
always calls `WriteRoot` with `dirPerCategory=True`, so this fix cannot
change any behavior the scientific gate or any other currently-passing
test exercises — confirmed by `git diff python/run_fit.py` returning
empty. The integration-gate rerun below is a no-regression check only.

### Verification performed

- Under `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter, the fixed
  test alone: **1 passed, 6.91s**.
- The full test file (all 5 tests, including the 3 kept unchanged from
  Chunk 16.A/16.B): **5 passed, 23.62s** — no regression to any
  already-passing test.
- Full lightweight suite: **195 passed, 20 deselected** — identical
  count to the post-16a.A baseline (this commit replaces one test with
  another, no net test-count change).
- Ruff/Black clean on both changed files.
- `git diff python/run_fit.py`: empty.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, general fix variant)

- [x] Step A's commit (`caa33e6`) named above; Step A's own
  characterization test is the one this commit replaces, per the plan's
  own Step B instruction (not left alongside as dead coverage).
- [x] Fix is minimal: 3 `.values()[-1]` -> `list(...values())[-1]`
  substitutions, nothing else touched.
- [x] Which channel is selected was confirmed empirically, not guessed
  — `list(...)[-1]` preserves the same "last inserted" convention the
  original indexing already followed.
- [x] `run_fit.py`'s call site confirmed unchanged (`git diff` empty),
  so this fix cannot affect any behavior the scientific gate exercises.
- [x] The updated test proves real content equivalence with the
  already-tested `dirPerCategory=True` branch, not just "does not
  raise."
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] This entry names Chunk 16a as now resolved; optional Chunk 16b,
  Chunk 17, and Chunk 18 remain explicitly open.

## Resolve GitHub Copilot PR review findings (Chunks 13-16 pull request)

### Objective

Address the 8 findings from GitHub Copilot's review of the Chunks
13-16 pull request (backend initialization, CI coverage, cleanup
reliability, and documentation consistency) before requesting another
review, per the review's own closing instruction.

### Findings and fixes

1. **`python/FindBHWindow.py` (medium, real regression) —
   `matplotlib.use("Agg")` was called too late.** `run_bump_hunter()`
   imports `pyBumpHunter`, whose own `BumpHunter1D` implementation
   imports `matplotlib.pyplot` at module load - by the time
   `save_bump_plots()` later called `matplotlib.use("Agg")`, a backend
   had already been selected. Confirmed by reading the original,
   pre-Tier-3 script directly (`git show 604b5cd~1:python/FindBHWindow.py`):
   it called `matplotlib.use("Agg")` **before** `import pyBumpHunter as
   BH`, at module scope - Chunk 14's own deferred-import split reversed
   that ordering. **Fixed**: moved `import matplotlib;
   matplotlib.use("Agg")` into `run_bump_hunter()`, immediately before
   `import pyBumpHunter as BH` - restoring the original ordering exactly,
   while keeping the deferred-import structure. `save_bump_plots()`'s own
   `matplotlib.use("Agg")` call is left in place (a harmless no-op once
   Agg is already active). Verified: the real end-to-end test
   (`test_findbhwindow_script_computes_expected_mask_window_for_real_fixture`)
   still passes with the exact same deterministic values.
2. **`python/createBinning.py` (medium) — error messages hardcoded the
   default filename instead of the actual `input_path` argument.** Both
   `raise OSError(...)` and `raise KeyError(...)` in
   `load_resolution_fit()` now interpolate the real `input_path` (`f"Could
   not open {input_path}"` / `f"ROOT object gsc_mjj_reso_fit not found in
   {input_path}"`), so a caller passing a non-default path gets an
   accurate error. The existing `test_load_resolution_fit_raises_keyerror_when_key_missing`
   test's assertion (`"gsc_mjj_reso_fit" in str(error)`) still passes
   unmodified - verified for real.
3. **`scripts/quality_check.py` / `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`
   (medium, real CI gap) — none of the four new test files' real-ROOT/
   real-dependency tests ever ran in CI.** Every test in
   `tests/test_create_binning.py`, `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py`,
   `tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py`'s marked tests, and
   `tests/test_find_bh_window.py`'s real end-to-end test carry
   `requires_analysis_dependencies`, which the lightweight gate's `-m
   "not requires_analysis_dependencies"` filter always excludes; the
   scientific workflow's own dedicated real-ROOT step only ever selected
   three older files (`test_plot_post_fit.py`/`test_plot_postfit_macro.py`/
   `test_read_bumphunter_results.py`) - the exact same gap this session
   already fixed once for those three (Copilot review, PR #6), now found
   again for four more files. **Fixed**: added all four new test files to
   the "Run plotting-layer real-ROOT regression gates" step's `pytest`
   invocation. Confirmed `tests/test_find_bh_window.py`'s real test needs
   no additional CI-level environment setup - its own subprocess probe
   already sources `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` and exports
   `PYTHONPATH` itself. Verified `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`
   still parses as valid YAML after the edit.
4. **`tests/test_create_binning.py` (medium) — the cleanup guard did not
   cover fixture-creation failures.** `_write_synthetic_resolution_fit()`
   was called *before* the `try:` block in
   `test_createBinning_script_produces_expected_binning_for_real_fixture`;
   if it created the file and then raised, the `finally:` cleanup never
   ran, leaving a generated fixture in the repository. **Fixed**: moved
   the call inside the `try:` block, so `finally:` covers every outcome.
5. **`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` (low, documentation) — Section 4.5
   miscounted the deferred-import files.** It claimed 4 of 5 files kept a
   module-level `import ROOT`, with `FindBHWindow.py` as "the one
   exception" - contradicting `createBinning.py`'s own shipped extraction
   (ROOT deferred into `load_resolution_fit()`/`build_binning_histogram()`/
   `main()`). **Fixed**: corrected the paragraph to name both
   `createBinning.py` and `FindBHWindow.py` as the two deferred-import
   files, with `ExtractFitParameters.py`/`ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`/
   `PreFit.py` (the last not yet executed) as the three that keep
   module-level `import ROOT`.
6. **`doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` (low, documentation) — Section 3's
   table and the diagram's `(*)` markers still described pre-Chunk-13-16
   state.** `createBinning.py`/`ExtractFitParameters.py`/
   `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`/`FindBHWindow.py` had all since been
   decomposed, tested, and registered, but the table still said "None"/
   "No" for each, and `createBinning.py` was still marked "does not
   parse." **Fixed**: removed the `(*)` markers for these four files from
   the trace diagram (kept `(!)` on `createBinning.py`'s historical
   defect note), updated the legend, moved the four files into Section
   2's "ARE part of the Tier 3 system" list with their real test-file
   names, and trimmed Section 3's table to the one file still outside the
   system (`python/PreFit.py`, Chunk 17) plus the shell setup script.
7. **`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` (low, documentation) — the "not yet executed"
   status for Chunks 13-18 was already false within the same change that
   added it.** **Fixed**: added a same-day, explicitly-dated correction
   noting Chunks 13-16 have since landed (four files now part of the
   system), with `PreFit.py`/Chunk 17 as the one still-open item and
   Chunk 18 (the deferred "Current status"/module-map rewrite) still
   pending - a targeted correction, not the full Chunk 18 update itself.
   Also corrected the "Purpose and audience" section's now-stale
   "non-Tier-3 files" list to name only `PreFit.py`.
8. **`tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py` (low, documentation) — a
   stale comment.** Said the module does `import ROOT` and `from ROOT
   import *`, but the same PR's earlier follow-up commit (`5bb6c09`)
   already removed the wildcard import. **Fixed**: corrected the comment
   to describe only `import ROOT`, with a note about the wildcard-import
   removal for context.

The one suppressed comment (`python/createBinning.py:37`, the `KeyError`
message) is the same finding as item 2 above and was fixed by the same
edit.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_create_binning.py
  tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py -v -m
  "requires_analysis_dependencies"` (ambient interpreter) -> **4 passed,
  19.70s**.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_find_bh_window.py -v -m
  "requires_analysis_dependencies"` (ambient interpreter) -> **1 passed,
  15.00s** - confirms the matplotlib-ordering fix still produces the
  exact same deterministic `MaskMin`/`MaskMax`/`BlindRange` values.
- `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"` on the edited workflow
  file: valid YAML.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **194 passed, 18
  deselected**, Ruff clean, Black clean (37 files unchanged), exit code
  0.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, general fix variant)

- [x] Every finding traced to its root cause and fixed directly, not
  worked around.
- [x] Item 1 is a real regression this session introduced (Chunk 14) -
  confirmed against the actual pre-refactor script via `git show`, not
  assumed from the review comment alone.
- [x] Item 3 closes a real CI coverage gap - the same category of gap
  already fixed once this session (PR #6) for three other files.
- [x] No scientific constant, reference, tolerance, or canonical
  workflow argument touched.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).

## Chunk 16b — Fix the 6-of-8 accessors' key-vs-value fallback bug

### Objective

Fix the second dormant bug Chunk 16.A characterized:
`GetNbins`/`GetNpars`/`GetNdof`/`GetH1Chi2`/`GetH1Postfit`/
`GetH1Residuals`'s no-`channelname` fallback did `next(iter(self.channel_X))`
(dict **keys**), unlike `GetChi2`/`GetPval`'s already-correct
`next(iter(self.channel_X.values()))`. Per
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 16b — optional, run after Chunk 16
(and Chunk 16a) landed. No new characterization commit was needed:
Chunk 16.A's own test already pinned this exact wrong-type-return
behavior; this commit fixes the production code and updates those same
reused assertions in one commit, per the plan's own text for this
chunk.

### What changed

- `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`: all 6 affected accessors' fallback
  changed from `next(iter(self.channel_X))` to
  `next(iter(self.channel_X.values()))`, matching `GetChi2`/`GetPval`'s
  pattern exactly. A short comment added above `GetChi2` pointing to
  this fix for the block below it.
- `tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py`:
  `test_extract_and_accessors_characterize_todays_real_and_buggy_behavior`
  renamed to `test_extract_and_accessors_produce_consistent_real_values`
  (it no longer characterizes any buggy behavior — both bugs Chunk 16.A
  found are now fixed, Chunk 16a's in the prior commit, Chunk 16b's in
  this one). The 6 reused assertions changed from asserting the
  channel-name string `"Run3TLA"` to asserting the real values
  (`2519`/`6`/`2513`/histogram bin counts); 6 new assertions added
  confirming each no-`channelname` call now returns exactly what the
  same accessor returns when `channelname="Run3TLA"` is supplied
  explicitly — proving all 8 accessors are now behaviorally consistent,
  not just that the wrong-type bug is gone.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed

Explicitly safe by construction, stated in the plan's own text: the
only production call site (`run_fit.py:160/162`,
`pfe.GetPval("Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned")`/
`pfe.GetPval("Run3TLA_rebinned")`) always supplies `channelname`
explicitly, so this fix cannot change any value that call site — or the
scientific gate, or any other currently-passing test — observes.
Confirmed via `git diff python/run_fit.py` returning empty.

### Verification performed

- Under `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter, the full
  test file (all 5 tests): **5 passed, 29.21s** — no regression to any
  already-passing test, and the new consistency assertions themselves
  passed.
- Full lightweight suite: **195 passed, 20 deselected** — identical
  count to the post-16a.B baseline (this commit only edits existing
  test assertions, no test added or removed).
- Ruff/Black clean on both changed files.
- `git diff python/run_fit.py`: empty.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, general fix variant)

- [x] Characterization already existed (Chunk 16.A, commit `9dd0ccd`);
  this commit's own text states explicitly why no new characterization
  commit was needed, per the plan's own instruction for this chunk.
- [x] Fix is minimal: 6 `next(iter(dict))` -> `next(iter(dict.values()))`
  substitutions, nothing else touched.
- [x] `run_fit.py`'s call site confirmed unchanged (`git diff` empty),
  so this fix cannot affect any behavior the scientific gate exercises
  — stated explicitly, matching the plan's own safety argument for
  fixing this post-hoc.
- [x] The updated test proves full 8-accessor consistency (no-arg call
  == explicit-channelname call), not just "no longer wrong type."
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] This entry names both optional Chunks 16a and 16b as now
  resolved; Chunk 17 (`PreFit.py`) and Chunk 18 (final documentation)
  remain the only open items in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`.

## Chunk 17.A — Characterization tests for python/PreFit.py

### Objective

Add `PreFitter`'s first-ever direct test, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 17, before any restructuring. The only existing test today
(`tests/test_run_templates.py::_install_fake_prefitter`) fakes the whole
class to exercise `run_templates.py`'s caller logic instead of
`PreFitter`'s own real behavior. Zero production code changed in this
commit.

### What changed

- New `tests/test_pre_fit.py`, following the same real-ROOT
  subprocess-snippet pattern already established for
  `ExtractFitParameters.py`/`ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` (`PreFit.py` also
  does `import ROOT` at module scope, unconditionally — no ROOT-free
  fragment exists yet).
- `test_fit_returns_expected_shape_and_is_deterministic_for_real_fixture`:
  real ROOT `TH1::Fit`, real `seed=42` determinism, against the
  already-committed `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J100_dataAll.root`
  fixture (the same fixture `run_templates.py`'s own `PreFitter` call
  site passes). `nPars`/`nRetries1`/`nRetries2` deliberately scaled
  down to `3`/`50`/`3` (vs. production's up-to-`10`/`2000*nPars`/
  `2*nPars`) purely for test speed — a characterization-strategy choice
  stated explicitly, not a synthetic substitute (this fixture is real
  and committed, distinct from Chunk 13's need for a wholly synthetic
  one). Pins down real, empirically-verified `(bestPars, nbkg)` values
  and proves two independent `PreFitter` instances built with the same
  seed reproduce an identical result.
- `test_fit_raises_indexerror_for_npars_above_seven_with_default_ranges`:
  characterizes, without fixing, `PreFitter.__init__`'s `parRangeLow`/
  `parRangeHigh` defaulting to 7-element lists while `nPars` can be
  requested up to 10 (`run_templates.py` already works around this by
  building its own longer lists when `nPars > 7` — see
  `run_templates.py:62-63`). Confirmed empirically that `nPars=8` with
  the default ranges raises `IndexError` partway through `Fit()`'s
  first `RandomizeParameters()` call.

### What this commit does NOT do

`python/PreFit.py` itself is untouched; `python/PreFit.py` and
`tests/test_pre_fit.py` are not yet registered in
`scripts/quality_check.py` — deferred to Chunk 17's Step B commit once
the production file's extraction lands, matching this plan's own
established Step A/Step B split for every prior chunk.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_pre_fit.py -v` (under
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter) — **2 passed**,
  run twice to confirm stability (~37-50s per run).
- Ruff/Black clean on `tests/test_pre_fit.py`.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` / `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)

- [x] Zero production code changed in this commit.
- [x] Both new tests run against real ROOT and a real, already-committed
  fixture — no synthetic substitute needed.
- [x] Today's real `IndexError` fragility for `nPars > 7` with default
  ranges is characterized, not fixed — matching Chunk 5's own
  precedent for pinning down a quirk exactly as-is.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] Chunk 17's Step B (extraction, registration) remains the next
  open item; Chunk 18 (final documentation) remains open after that.

## Chunk 17.B — Extract PreFitter's candidate-building and sampling logic

### Objective

Decompose `PreFitter.Fit()` (130 lines, this file's only large method)
into two new private helper methods, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
Chunk 17's Section 4.4 target table, with `Fit()` becoming the
orchestrator, then register `python/PreFit.py` and
`tests/test_pre_fit.py` in `scripts/quality_check.py`.

### What changed

- `_build_candidate_functions(self)`: builds the 10 linear-mode and 10
  log-mode candidate `TF1`s (`NParFunction[1..10]`,
  `LogNParFunction[1..10]`). Moved out as a named block only — every
  formula/range is byte-for-byte unchanged from today's `Fit()`.
- `_select_best_parameter_sets(self, fitFunction, integral, score_fn,
  nRetries1, nRetries2)`: isolates the randomize/score/array-bisect
  bookkeeping that used to live directly inside `Fit()`'s own sampling
  loop. Takes a `score_fn` callable (`Fit()` passes a
  `lambda fn: h.Chisquare(fn)` closure) rather than the data histogram
  itself, so it has no ROOT calls of its own beyond scoring the
  candidate function it's handed — this is what makes it independently
  testable below without a live ROOT histogram, going further than the
  plan's own "if achievable" bar for this chunk.
- `Fit()` is now the orchestrator: reads/log-transforms the data
  histogram, calls the two new helpers, refits the survivors with
  `TH1::Fit` exactly as before. The two-phase `TStopwatch` is split into
  two separate instances (one now local to `_select_best_parameter_sets`,
  one for the refit phase in `Fit()`) instead of one object reused via
  `.Reset()` — same measurement windows, same stdout print order, no
  observable change.
- Lint debt fixed proactively in this same commit (same root cause as
  Chunk 15's follow-up lint fix — never linted until registration):
  `import math, array, bisect` / `import sys, argparse` split into
  one-per-line, sorted; the dead `math` import removed (only
  `ROOT.TMath` was ever used); `# noqa: E501` added to the
  pre-existing, unsplittable long `TF1` formula-string literals,
  matching the existing pattern already used elsewhere in this repo
  (`python/run_anaFit.py`, `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`).

### Tests added

`tests/test_pre_fit.py` gained 2 new fast, ROOT-free unit tests — this
repository's first stub-free unit test of any piece of `PreFit.py`'s own
logic, achievable here (unlike Chunk 15/16's extractor classes) because
`_select_best_parameter_sets()` takes an already-built candidate and a
plain scoring callable instead of reaching into a live ROOT histogram
itself:
- `test_build_candidate_functions_returns_ten_linear_and_ten_log_candidates`:
  asserts all 20 candidates exist with the documented
  `{n}ParFunction`/`Log{n}ParFunction` names and `xMin`/`xMax`, with
  exact formula-text spot checks on the simplest and most complex
  candidate in each family (the remaining 16 forms are exercised for
  real by the existing real-ROOT `Fit()` test, which selects
  `NParFunction[3]`/`LogNParFunction[3]` via `nPars=3`).
- `test_select_best_parameter_sets_ranks_and_bounds_output_and_is_deterministic`:
  against a hand-built fake `TF1` candidate and a plain
  summed-abs-params scoring callable, asserts the returned list is
  exactly `nRetries2` long, every entry finite (the initial
  `(inf, [])` sentinel is provably evicted whenever
  `nRetries1 >= nRetries2`), sorted ascending by chi2, and that two
  independent runs with the same `seed=42` reproduce an identical
  ranked result.

Both new fast tests stub `sys.modules["ROOT"]` with a minimal fake
module (`_FakeTRandom3` wraps Python's own seeded `random.Random` so
`RandomizeParameters`' draw sequence stays deterministic;
`_FakeTStopwatch`/`_FakeTMath`/`_FakeMinimizerOptions`/`_FakeGROOT` are
inert), the same `sys.modules`-stub convention Chunk 15's
`GetNsig`/`GetNsigErr` regression tests already established. Step A's 2
real-ROOT subprocess tests are unchanged and re-verified to still pass
against this decomposed structure with the exact same pinned values —
no Test Relocation Rule move was needed since Step A already created
`tests/test_pre_fit.py` in its final location.

### What this commit does NOT do

The `parRangeLow`/`parRangeHigh` 7-vs-10-element `IndexError` fragility
is left exactly as Step A characterized it, not fixed — out of this
chunk's explicitly-listed scope. `run_templates.py`'s call site is
unchanged.

### Verification performed

- `python -m pytest tests/test_pre_fit.py -v` (under
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s ambient interpreter) -> **4 passed**
  (2 real-ROOT subprocess tests re-verified against the decomposed file
  with identical pinned values; 2 new fast ROOT-free tests).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` -> **196 passed, 20
  deselected** (up from 194/18 — the 2 new fast tests now included),
  Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m
  "integration and requires_root" -v` (via the mandatory pre-commit
  hook) -> **1 passed, 2 deselected, 182.11s** — no regression.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` / `git diff --check`: clean.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)

- [x] Step A's commit (`83d3f7a`) named above; no test relocation was
  needed.
- [x] No scientific constant, reference, tolerance, dependency revision,
  or canonical workflow argument touched.
- [x] Every newly-introduced function has a dedicated, genuinely new
  test exercising it directly (not copied from Step A) — and both are
  ROOT-free, a first for this file's own logic.
- [x] `run_templates.py` still constructs `PreFitter` the same way —
  no changes to that file in this commit.
- [x] The `parRangeLow`/`parRangeHigh` 7-vs-10 `IndexError` fragility
  remains untouched, exactly as Step A characterized it.
- [x] `scripts/quality_check.py` registration done in this same commit
  (guardrail 5), and the newly-registered production file's own lint
  findings fixed proactively, not left for a later CI failure.
- [x] All required gates ran and passed, output captured above.
- [x] `git diff --check` passes.
- [x] Activity-log entry appended (this content).
- [x] This entry names Chunk 17 as now resolved; Chunk 18 (final
  documentation) remains the only open item in
  `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`.

## 2026-09-04: Tier-3 refactoring — Chunk 18: documentation update for the extended scope

### Objective

Revise the three documents Chunks 13-17 touch (`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`,
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`) so none of them
still claims a narrower or "finished" scope than the repository actually
has, per `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Chunk 18's own required-contents
list. Single commit, documentation only - no target function exists to
characterize, matching Chunk 12's own precedent for this kind of chunk.

### What changed

- **`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`**: Section 0/3's extended-scope
  language, Section 9's "Chunks 0 through 18" completion definition
  (including the five files' final decomposition/test/registration
  bullet and the `FindBHWindow.py`/`createBinning.py` scientific-gate
  caveat), and Section 10's "nine named" scope-boundary text were all
  already present from Chunks 13-17's own work - confirmed by re-reading
  the document in full, not assumed. The one genuinely stale claim found
  and fixed: Section 4.5's parenthetical "(Chunk 17, not yet executed)"
  next to `PreFit.py`, now that Chunk 17 has landed.
- **`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`**: added a new, dated "Chunk 18 update
  (2026-09-04)" paragraph directly after the existing same-day note that
  anticipated it (Chunks 13-16 landed / PreFit.py not yet executed) -
  the original note stays exactly as written, per this document's own
  established practice of layering dated corrections rather than
  editing prior text. Added: a matching dated paragraph under "Current
  status" recording Chunks 13-18's own final gate numbers (196 passed,
  20 deselected lightweight; 1 passed, 2 deselected, 182.11s scientific)
  and the `FindBHWindow.py`/`createBinning.py` scientific-gate caveat; a
  "Chunks 13-18" bullet in "Scope" plus correcting "four files" to
  "nine" in its out-of-scope paragraph; a new "Module map: hot-path
  support scripts" table (5 rows, built from the actual `def`/import
  lines in all five production files, not from memory of the plan's own
  target tables); 5 new "Test-file map" rows (built from each test
  file's actual `@pytest.mark` lines); a new "FindBHWindow.py
  dedicated-interpreter gate" subsection under "Gate commands" (the
  literal command from `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Section 7); 6 new
  "Known limitations" entries (`ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`'s two
  originally-named bugs now fixed plus the third, newly-found one still
  preserved; `FindBHWindow.py`'s masked-path gate-coverage gap; the
  `wsfile` double-meaning, cross-checked directly against
  `python/run_fit.py`'s actual `FitParameterExtractor(wsfile=...)`/
  `PostfitExtractor(wsfile=...)` call sites; `PreFit.py`'s 7-vs-10
  fragility; `createBinning.py`'s unchecked `execute()` return code,
  cross-referenced to `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` Section 5; the
  `numpy`-stub technique, cross-checked directly that this repository's
  dev venv has no `numpy` installed at all) plus correcting the same
  stale "four files" bullet; the five new files added to "Authoritative
  files"; and an "Extended (2026-09-04, Chunks 13-18)" paragraph added to
  "Completion definition". Also corrected two passages that were not
  merely historical but actively wrong as of today - the top-level title
  and intro paragraph's implicit "four files only" framing, and a
  "which file (`python/PreFit.py`) a real J100/J50 run still calls
  outside the Tier 3 system" sentence that was flatly false the moment
  Chunk 17 landed - both rewritten to state the current, extended scope
  directly rather than left to stand uncorrected beside a dated note.
- **`doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`**: removed the sole remaining `(*)`
  marker from Section 1's call-graph diagram (`python/PreFit.py`'s line)
  and rewrote the legend paragraph beneath it to state plainly that no
  file carries the marker any more; extended Section 2's "Also part of
  the system" paragraph from "Chunks 13-16"/four files to "Chunks 13-17"/
  all five, adding `PreFit.py`'s own detail (module-level `import ROOT`
  retained, but its sampling/ranking logic isolated behind a plain
  scoring-callable interface - this plan's first stub-free, ROOT-free
  unit test of any piece of one of these five files' own logic); rewrote
  Section 3 to drop the now-empty `python/PreFit.py` row entirely,
  leaving only the always-out-of-scope, non-Python
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`, and revised its closing sentence to
  state the boundary "is no longer something this document is proposing
  to change; it has changed."

### Verification performed

- Every module-map/test-file-map fact was read directly from the actual
  production and test files (`grep -n "^def "`/`@pytest.mark` lines
  across all five files and their five test files) in this session, not
  carried forward from the plan's own target tables or from memory.
- `run_fit.py`'s two extractor call sites were grepped directly
  (`FitParameterExtractor(wsfile=fitresultfile)` at line 168,
  `PostfitExtractor(..., wsfile=fitresultfile, ...)` at lines 144-153)
  to confirm the `wsfile` double-meaning claim before writing it.
- `.venv/bin/python -c "import numpy"` run directly, confirming
  `ModuleNotFoundError` before writing the numpy-stub Known Limitations
  entry.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md
  doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` → clean.
- `git diff --check` → clean.
- `git diff --stat` → exactly the three documents this chunk names,
  zero production or test files touched.

### Compliance review

1. Chunk 18, single commit (documentation only - no Step A/Step B split
   applies, matching Chunk 12's own precedent).
2. Every required-contents item from Chunk 18's own list (Section 6) is
   present in all three documents: extended-scope confirmation, the
   dated superseding note (not a silent rewrite of the existing "all
   twelve chunks" status line - that line stays exactly as written), the
   new module-map table, the 5 new test-file-map rows, the 6 named Known
   Limitations entries, the new `FindBHWindow.py` gate command, the
   extended "Authoritative files"/"Completion definition", and Section
   3's five-files-moved/`(*)`-markers-removed/boundary-sentence-revised
   changes in `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`.
3. No production or test code touched - `git diff --stat` shows only the
   three named documents.
4. Every factual claim was checked against the actual repository state
   in this session before being written (see "Verification performed"),
   not carried forward from possibly-stale earlier chunk text.
5. The activity log's append-only rule was honored inside
   `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`/`doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` too, in the same
   spirit Chunk 18's own instruction asked for: existing dated notes and
   the original "Current status"/Section 3 tables were superseded by new
   dated paragraphs and table edits, not silently rewritten in place,
   except where a passage was actively, factually wrong as of today (not
   merely an old historical claim) - those two are called out explicitly
   above rather than left standing uncorrected.
6. Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any
   existing section.

### Remaining open chunks

None. All eighteen chunks of `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` (0 through
18, including both optional Chunks 16a and 16b) are complete.

## Rewrite doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md as pure reference documentation

### Objective

At the user's explicit request: bring `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` closer to
`doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`/`doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s style - a reference
document describing the current system, not a chronological record of
how it was built. Removed every "Chunk N" label, dated "Update
(2026-09-04): ..." note, GitHub Copilot PR-review citation, and commit
hash from the document; folded their surviving technical content
(module maps, design rationale, known limitations, gate commands) into
plain, present-tense statements about the system as it exists today.
Nothing in `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` or `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`
was touched - both are legitimately historical/planning documents by
design (the completion plan is "the current Tier 3 backlog, step
structure, and guardrails"; the execution trace is a dated trace with
its own defect narrative), and the user's request was scoped to
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` specifically.

### What changed

- Collapsed the six-paragraph "Purpose and audience" intro (which had
  grown three separate dated "Update" notes tracking Chunks 13-16, then
  17, then 18 landing) into two short paragraphs stating the document's
  current scope directly.
- Collapsed "Current status" from two dated paragraphs (Chunks 0-12's
  original text, then a separate "Chunks 13-18 extended this system"
  paragraph) into one unified description covering all nine files, with
  a single current lightweight-gate and scientific-gate result each
  (no superseded historical numbers kept alongside them).
- "Scope" no longer distinguishes "the original four" from "the five
  Chunks 13-18 added" - both in-scope and out-of-scope lists now name
  all nine files as one set.
- The `run_masking.py`/`should_mask()` module-map entry no longer
  attributes the NaN-safe implementation choice to "a GitHub Copilot
  review finding" - it states the technical reason (float `>`/`<=`
  disagree only for `NaN`) directly.
- Renamed "Decisions recorded during extraction" to "Design notes" and
  moved each file's own rationale next to that file's module-map table
  (one "Design notes" subsection per module map) instead of one combined
  section keyed by chunk number - dropped every "Chunk N (...)" heading
  in favor of naming the file/function directly.
- "Module map: hot-path support scripts" dropped its "(Chunks 13-17,
  added 2026-09-04)" heading suffix and each row's "(Chunk 13)"/
  "(Chunk 14)"/etc. suffix.
- "Known limitations" dropped every "(Chunk 16a)"/"(Chunk 16b)"/
  "(Chunk 13)" parenthetical and the "GitHub Copilot review, PR #6"
  citation; the `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` entry no longer narrates that
  two bugs "are now fixed" by two separately-numbered bug-fix chunks -
  it simply doesn't list them as limitations any more (they're fixed),
  and states only the one bug that remains: the `hpdf`/`hpdf_bkg` Scale
  mismatch in `_build_bkgonly_variant`.
- "Gate commands" dropped the "(Chunk 14, added 2026-09-04)" heading
  suffix and the "Rerun again after Chunk 17.B's ... unchanged result"
  historical progression - each gate now states one current result.
- "Authoritative files" dropped the "(Chunks 13-17, added 2026-09-04)"
  heading suffix on the hot-path-scripts file list.
- "Completion definition" merged the original Chunk-12-only paragraph
  and the separate "Extended (2026-09-04, Chunks 13-18)" paragraph into
  one, covering all nine files and dropping the commit-hash citations
  (`b026efd`, `83d3f7a`, `dab5cbd`).

No technical fact was removed in this pass - every module-map row,
design rationale, known limitation, and gate command from the prior
version survives, restated without its chunk/date/commit/PR framing.

### Verification performed

- `grep -ni "chunk\|2026-09\|copilot\|PR #\|commit \`" doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`
  -> no matches.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` -> clean.
- `git diff --check` -> clean.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` (rerun, doc-only change
  should not affect it) -> 196 passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black
  clean (39 files unchanged), exit code 0.
- `git diff --stat` -> `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` only.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a documentation-style revision to an already-complete
Tier 3, not a new chunk.

## Correct a real scope inaccuracy: python/repo_utils.py is on the J100/J50 hot path

### Objective

At the user's prompting ("why does the scope not include the trace of
all files within the analysis process"), re-verified whether every file
Tier 3's own documents claim is "out of scope, untouched" is actually
untouched by a real J100/J50 run. It is not: `python/repo_utils.py` is
genuinely imported and exercised on that path
(`run_provenance.py:8: from repo_utils import find_repo_root`, called by
`get_repository_root()`, called by `build_analysis_provenance(...)`,
which every real run invokes), yet `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` and
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` both listed it as an example of a file "not part
of the background-only J100/J50 canonical path" - directly contradicted
by `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`'s own trace diagram, which has always
shown `get_repository_root() -> repo_utils.find_repo_root()`.

Checked every remaining candidate before concluding this was the only
gap: grepped every `import`/`from` line across all 15 already-recognized
hot-path Python files (excluding stdlib/ROOT/numpy/matplotlib/uproot/
pyBumpHunter) - `repo_utils` was the only first-party module surfacing
that wasn't already accounted for. Separately confirmed
`python/analysis_reference.py` (only imported by tests and
`scripts/quality_check.py`, never by production code),
`python/run_injections_anaFit.py` (a distinct entry point, not invoked
by `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`/`run_anaFit_J50.sh`), and
`scripts/compare_root_outputs.py` (only imported by
`tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py`) are genuinely untouched by the
J100/J50 workflow - their "out of scope" listing is accurate and
unchanged.

No new decomposition was needed for `repo_utils.py`: it was already
brought to Tier 3's own standard (four small, single-purpose,
individually-tested functions, registered in `scripts/quality_check.py`)
by `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s own earlier work, before this plan existed.
This is a documentation-accuracy fix only.

### What changed

- `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Section 3's out-of-scope bullet: removed
  `python/repo_utils.py` from the list of examples of untouched files
  (it now names only the two that genuinely are:
  `python/analysis_reference.py`, `python/run_injections_anaFit.py`),
  and added an explicit note explaining why `repo_utils.py` is the one
  exception - on the hot path, but requiring no work because Tier 1/2
  already met the bar.
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`: "Scope" section's out-of-scope paragraph gets
  the same correction, plus a new paragraph naming `repo_utils.py` as a
  tenth file on the workflow. The "This document's scope is exactly the
  nine files named above" Known Limitations bullet now says "plus
  `python/repo_utils.py`'s pre-existing standard." "Authoritative files"
  gains a new "Also on the same hot path, owned by
  `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`" line listing `python/repo_utils.py`.
- `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`: Section 1's diagram gains a
  `<-- python/repo_utils.py` annotation on the
  `get_repository_root() -> repo_utils.find_repo_root()` line, matching
  every other file's annotation style. Section 2 gains a paragraph
  documenting this finding directly, including the correction to
  `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s prior text.

### Verification performed

- `grep -rln "repo_utils" --include=*.py .` and manual read of
  `python/run_provenance.py:8` confirm the real import.
- `grep -nE "^\s*(import|from)\s+" <every hot-path Python file>` filtered
  against stdlib/ROOT/numpy/matplotlib/uproot/pyBumpHunter/datetime -
  `repo_utils` was the only first-party module found unaccounted for.
- `grep -rln "analysis_reference\|compare_root_outputs" --include=*.py .`
  confirm both are only imported by tests/`quality_check.py`, never by
  production code.
- `grep -rln "run_injections_anaFit"` against
  `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`/`run_anaFit_J50.sh` returns nothing.
- Read `python/repo_utils.py` in full: 4 small functions, already
  docstringed, matching Tier 3's own decomposition bar.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` across all three documents: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` (doc-only change,
  re-verified unaffected): 196 passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black
  clean (39 files unchanged), exit code 0.
- `git diff --stat`: exactly the three named documents.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a documentation-accuracy correction to an already-complete
Tier 3, not a new chunk - and it required no new decomposition, test, or
registration work, since `python/repo_utils.py` already met Tier 3's own
standard before this plan began.

## Fill in python/repo_utils.py's missing Test-file map row

### Objective

At the user's prompting ("are all of these files included in tier3
system documentation"), systematically cross-checked every one of the
17 files on the J100/J50 hot path (the nine Tier-3-decomposed files plus
the eight already-decomposed coordinator/plotting files, plus
`python/repo_utils.py`) against `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s three canonical
lookup tables/lists: "Module map" (x3), "Test-file map", and
"Authoritative files". `python/repo_utils.py` was present in "Scope",
"Known limitations", and "Authoritative files", but missing from the
"Test-file map" table - the concrete table a reader would actually
consult to answer "which test file exercises this."

### What changed

- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s "Test-file map" gains a `python/repo_utils.py`
  row (`tests/test_repo_utils.py`), read directly from the test file's
  own `@pytest.mark` lines rather than assumed: `find_repo_root()`/
  `build_repo_snapshot()`/`write_repo_snapshot()`/`read_repo_snapshot()`'s
  own tests need no ROOT or other heavy dependency, but two other,
  unrelated tests in that same file (external Git-submodule-revision
  checks - Tier 1/2's own installation policy, nothing to do with
  `repo_utils.py`'s own functions) are separately marked
  `requires_analysis_dependencies` - stated explicitly so the row isn't
  a flat, misleading "No."
- "Scope"'s `repo_utils.py` paragraph now names all four of its
  functions explicitly (matching every other file's level of detail in
  this document) and states which one is actually on the hot path.

### Verification performed

- `grep -c "<filename>" doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` for all 17 hot-path files:
  every one has at least one mention.
- `sed -n '/Test-file map/,/Gate commands/p' doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md | grep -c "^| \`"`
  -> 18 rows (17 files + `plot_postfit.cpp`'s `read_bumphunter_results()`
  extra row) after this fix - was 17 before.
- `sed -n '/Authoritative files/,/Change control/p' doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`
  cross-checked line by line against the 17-file list: all present.
- `grep -n "@pytest.mark" tests/test_repo_utils.py`: confirmed exactly 2
  of 14 test functions are `requires_analysis_dependencies`, and read
  both to confirm they check external submodule revisions, not
  `repo_utils.py`'s own functions.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 196 passed, 20
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files unchanged), exit 0.
- `git diff --stat`: `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` only.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a documentation-completeness correction to an
already-complete Tier 3, not a new chunk.

## Fix a real CI gap: tests/test_pre_fit.py's real-ROOT tests never ran in any job

### Objective

While investigating whether a single command exists to run the analysis
and all test files, checked which CI workflow step actually runs each
`requires_analysis_dependencies`-marked test file. Found that
`tests/test_pre_fit.py` (added by Chunk 17) was never added to
`.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`'s "Run plotting-layer
real-ROOT regression gates" step - the only CI step that runs anything
the lightweight gate deselects. Its two real-ROOT tests
(`test_fit_returns_expected_shape_and_is_deterministic_for_real_fixture`,
`test_fit_raises_indexerror_for_npars_above_seven_with_default_ranges`)
have therefore never run in any CI job at all, on any push to this
branch since Chunk 17 landed - the exact same class of gap this
workflow step's own comment already records being found and fixed twice
before, for other files, now repeated a third time.

Also found, while fixing this, that `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s own
"Plotting-layer real-ROOT gate" section had drifted out of sync with the
real workflow file even before this: it still documented the original
3-file command from Chunk 11/12, never updated when Chunks 13-16 grew
the real workflow step to 7 files.

### What changed

- `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`: added `tests/test_pre_fit.py`
  to the "Run plotting-layer real-ROOT regression gates" step's pytest
  file list. Rewrote the step's own comment to stop naming specific past
  chunk numbers for the file list (which is exactly what went stale) and
  instead state the actual rule going forward: every test file with a
  `requires_analysis_dependencies` test must be added to this list in
  the same commit that introduces it.
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s "Plotting-layer real-ROOT gate" section:
  updated the documented command to the real, current 8-file list (was
  3), and updated the "6 tests"/"11 passed" claims to the real, freshly
  measured 18 selected / 46 total.

### Verification performed

- `grep -rn "test_pre_fit" .github/workflows/*.yml` before this fix:
  no matches - confirmed the gap directly, not assumed from the
  workflow's own comment.
- `grep -rl "requires_analysis_dependencies" tests/*.py`: 10 files
  carry the marker; cross-checked each against the workflow step's file
  list (`test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`/`test_repo_utils.py`
  are covered by their own separate steps) - `test_pre_fit.py` was the
  only one missing.
- Ran the exact fixed command for real, under
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`'s sourced interpreter:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py
  tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py
  tests/test_create_binning.py tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py
  tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py tests/test_find_bh_window.py
  tests/test_pre_fit.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v` ->
  **18 passed, 28 deselected, 69.98s**, including both of
  `test_pre_fit.py`'s real-ROOT tests for the first time in this CI
  step's history.
- Reran the same 8 files unfiltered (no `-m`) to confirm the
  "equivalent on a CVMFS host" claim: **46 passed, 44.30s**.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` on both changed files: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 196 passed, 20
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files unchanged), exit 0
  (unaffected - this fix touches no lightweight-gate target).
- `git diff --stat`: `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` and
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` only.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a CI-coverage bug fix plus a documentation-sync
correction to an already-complete Tier 3, not a new chunk.

## Add scripts/run_all_gates.sh: a single command for every gate

### Objective

At the user's request, create a single command that runs the analysis
and every test file. No such command existed - the checks were split
across four separate invocations (the lightweight gate, the scientific
gate, the plotting-layer/hot-path real-ROOT gate, and the
FindBHWindow.py dedicated-interpreter gate), plus the prepared-
dependency checks inside `tests/test_repo_utils.py`.

### What changed

- New `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` (executable), running in order: (1) the
  lightweight quality gate; (2) the real J100/J50 scientific analysis,
  end to end; (3) the plotting-layer and hot-path-support real-ROOT
  regression gate (the 8-file list `test_pre_fit.py` was just added to);
  (4) the prepared external-dependency checkout checks; (5) the
  FindBHWindow.py dedicated-interpreter gate, run against the committed
  J100 `PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root` fixture inside a throwaway
  temp directory (avoids leaving `bump.png`/`BH_statistics.png` in the
  repo root - confirmed these files are written to the working directory
  by direct observation before adding the temp-dir wrapper). Prints a
  PASSED/FAILED line per gate, runs every gate regardless of earlier
  failures, and exits non-zero if any failed. Unlike `.githooks/pre-commit`
  (which skips the ROOT-dependent half with a warning when CVMFS isn't
  mounted, so a commit is never blocked on a machine that legitimately
  lacks it), this script fails loudly if the ROOT runtime isn't
  available, since its whole purpose is to run every gate.
- Two new tests in `tests/test_repo_utils.py`:
  `test_run_all_gates_script_covers_every_requires_analysis_dependencies_test_file`
  and
  `test_ci_scientific_workflow_covers_every_requires_analysis_dependencies_test_file`.
  Both grep every `tests/test_*.py` file for the
  `requires_analysis_dependencies` marker and assert the new script (and
  the CI workflow file, respectively) reference every one of them - the
  same class of gap just fixed for `tests/test_pre_fit.py`, now
  regression-tested going forward instead of relying on a human noticing
  a third time. Confirmed the CI-workflow test actually catches a
  regression: temporarily removed `test_pre_fit.py` from
  `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` and reran the test - it
  failed with the exact missing filename named in the assertion message,
  then restored the file with `git checkout --`.
- `README.md` gains a "Run every gate in one command" subsection
  pointing at the new script. `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s "Gate commands"
  section gains a matching entry at the top, and its lightweight-gate
  test count is updated from 196 to 198 (the two new tests above).

### Verification performed

- `bash -n scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: syntax OK.
- `shellcheck scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: no actual warnings (two
  info-level SC2016 hits on intentionally-deferred variable expansion
  inside nested `bash -lc`/`trap` strings, not bugs).
- Ran the full script for real, twice: first run caught a real bug (a
  stray `set -e` before `source scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` in the
  FindBHWindow step broke sourcing, since that script contains commands
  that legitimately return non-zero mid-script - the same reason every
  other gate in this script and `.githooks/pre-commit` avoid `set -e`
  around that line). Fixed, then reran end to end: all 5 gates PASSED,
  exit code 0, ~2m45s, `git status --short` clean afterward (no stray
  plot files).
- `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -v`: 16 passed, including
  both new tests.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 198 passed (up from
  196), 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files unchanged),
  exit code 0.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` across all changed files: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `git diff --stat`: `README.md`, `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`,
  `tests/test_repo_utils.py`, plus the new `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is new convenience tooling plus its own regression tests,
added to an already-complete Tier 3, not a new chunk.

## 2026-09-07 — Refresh Tier 1/2 documentation and fold in the new gate-completeness tests

### Objective
The user asked for a correctness pass over `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`,
`doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`, and `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`, and
for the two new gate-completeness tests (added alongside
`scripts/run_all_gates.sh`) to be reflected there.

### What changed

- All three documents carried the same stale "Latest verified result"
  snapshot from early Tier-1/2 baselining: `105 collected`, `103
  passed`, and either `2 prepared-dependency tests deselected` or `11
  deselected` for the prepared-dependency gate alone, plus stale
  per-gate timings (`16.39 seconds` for runtime readiness, `152.86
  seconds` for the scientific characterization gate). Re-ran every gate
  for real and replaced these with current numbers: lightweight gate
  `218 collected, 198 passed, 20 deselected`; prepared-dependency gate
  (`tests/test_repo_utils.py -m requires_analysis_dependencies`) `2
  passed, 14 deselected`; scientific runtime readiness `2.62 seconds`;
  authoritative J100/J50 characterization gate `73.22 seconds`. ROOT
  6.26/08, Python 3.9.12, and the LCG_102a/x86_64-centos9-gcc11-opt
  platform were independently reverified as still accurate and left
  unchanged.
- `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s "Scope boundary" sentence still read as if
  Tier-3 refactoring had not yet started ("Tier-3 refactoring may
  proceed after this installer build-mode change set is..."), despite
  Tier 3 having been under way and mostly complete for many chunks.
  Reworded to state that Tier-3 refactoring proceeds under the Tier-1
  safety net and must keep this document's gates passing, with a
  pointer to `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`.
- Added a new "Run every gate in one command" entry (`bash
  scripts/run_all_gates.sh`) to `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s Gate commands,
  `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s Gate operation, and
  `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`'s Verification commands - the
  script composes exactly these tiers' own gates (plus Tier 3's), but
  none of the three documents mentioned it even though README.md already
  points to them as the "complete operating and validation details" for
  it.
- `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s new gate entry and
  `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s "Current lightweight coverage" list now
  explicitly name the two new tests in `tests/test_repo_utils.py`
  (`test_run_all_gates_script_covers_every_requires_analysis_dependencies_test_file`,
  `test_ci_scientific_workflow_covers_every_requires_analysis_dependencies_test_file`)
  and what they guard against, rather than leaving them covered only
  implicitly by the generic "tests/test_repo_utils.py" file-level
  listing both documents already carried.

### Verification performed

- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 198 passed, 20
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0 (before and after the
  edits - these are documentation-only changes).
- Re-ran, for real, on this machine (CVMFS/ROOT available):
  `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m
  "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v` (2 passed, 14 deselected);
  `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -k
  authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime -v` (1 passed, 2
  deselected, 2.62s); `python -m pytest
  tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and
  requires_root" -v` (1 passed, 2 deselected, 73.22s); `root-config
  --version` and `python -c "import ROOT; print(ROOT.gROOT.GetVersion())"`
  (both `6.26/08`).
- Confirmed every file named in Tier-1's "Authoritative files" list and
  Tier-2's "Approved lightweight tests"/"Approved source targets" lists
  still exists at its stated path.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md
  doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `git diff --stat`: `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a documentation-accuracy pass over already-complete Tier
1/2 systems, not a new chunk.

## 2026-09-07 — Address GitHub Copilot PR review findings (Chunk 17, run_all_gates.sh)

### Objective
Respond to a Copilot automated review on the open PR covering Chunk 17
(`python/PreFit.py`) and the `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` gate-coverage
work. Verify each finding directly against the real files before
changing anything, rather than trusting the review's diff at face
value.

### What changed

- **Real gap, confirmed and fixed**: `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`'s Gate
  2 (`-m "integration and requires_root"` against
  `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`) selects only
  `test_authoritative_j100_j50_workflows_match_frozen_reference`. It
  never ran `test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime` (the
  scientific runtime-readiness gate documented in
  `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`) - sourcing `setup_buildAndFit.sh` is not a
  substitute, since that test also checks required fixtures and
  executable artifacts. Added it back as its own numbered gate; the
  script is now 6 gates, not 5 (renumbered throughout, header comment
  and `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s "Run every gate in one command" entry
  updated from "three gates above" to "four gates above" accordingly).
- **Real gap, confirmed and fixed**: both new
  `tests/test_repo_utils.py` gate-coverage tests
  (`test_run_all_gates_script_covers_every_...`,
  `test_ci_scientific_workflow_covers_every_...`) searched raw
  script/workflow text for `"tests/<filename>"`, so a commented-out
  reference would still satisfy them, and both blanket-exempted
  `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py` from the check
  entirely - which is exactly how the Gate-2 omission above went
  undetected by the very tests meant to catch this class of bug.
  Replaced the blanket exemption with an explicit per-test assertion
  (`_INTEGRATION_TEST_SELECTORS`) that each of that file's two
  `requires_analysis_dependencies` tests has its own dedicated selector
  present in the gate text, and added `_strip_full_line_comments()` so
  a commented-out line can never satisfy either check. Reproduced the
  original Gate-2 bug (commented out the runtime-readiness invocation)
  and confirmed the fixed test now fails with the exact missing test
  name, then restored; same proof for a commented-out
  `tests/test_pre_fit.py` line in the CI workflow file.
- **Real, order-dependent test bug, confirmed and fixed**:
  `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s `_make_stubbed_prefitter()` only patched
  `sys.modules["ROOT"]`, not `python.PreFit`'s own already-imported
  `ROOT` global - since that module stays cached in `sys.modules`
  across tests, a `from python import PreFit` after the first call
  does not re-run `import ROOT`, so a later call's fresh fake was
  silently ignored in favor of whichever fake the *first* call in the
  process happened to install. Reproduced by running
  `test_select_best_parameter_sets_...` before
  `test_build_candidate_functions_...` via explicit node IDs: failed
  with `AttributeError: module 'ROOT' has no attribute 'TF1'`. Fixed by
  adding `monkeypatch.setattr(pre_fit, "ROOT", fake_root_module)`
  immediately after import; reran both orders (declared and reversed) -
  both now pass.
- **Documentation-accuracy fixes** (no behavior change): "stub-free"
  was inaccurate everywhere it appeared for `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s
  two new unit tests - they install a fully-stubbed `ROOT` module, and
  `_select_best_parameter_sets()` itself still calls
  `ROOT.TStopwatch`/`ROOT.TMath.Exp`/`ROOT.TMath.Log`, so "ROOT-free"
  was never accurate; "histogram-independent, ROOT-stubbed" is.
  Corrected the wording in `python/PreFit.py`'s own docstring,
  `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s comment header, `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s
  `PreFit.py` module-map row, `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`'s Section
  2 paragraph, and `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s Chunk 17 Step B
  text. `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`'s own earlier "stub-free" entries
  (Chunk 17.B, and the Chunk 13-18 planning entry) are left unedited,
  per this file's own append-only rule - this entry is the correction
  of record for both.
- **Documentation-accuracy fix**: `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s
  `_build_candidate_functions()` test comment claimed the real-ROOT
  test above exercises "the remaining 16 forms ... for real, end to
  end (nPars=3 selects NParFunction[3]/LogNParFunction[3])". Checked
  `Fit()` directly: with `fitLog=True` it always selects
  `LogNParFunction[nPars]`, never `NParFunction[nPars]`, in the same
  run - so exactly one of the twenty candidate forms (`Log3ParFunction`)
  is exercised end to end by that test, not sixteen. Corrected the
  comment to state this precisely.

## 2026-09-07 — Address a second round of GitHub Copilot PR review findings (Chunk 17)

### Objective
Respond to a further Copilot review round on the same open PR, which
flagged a real behavior-preservation regression in the refactored
`Fit()` plus a few leftover "ROOT-free" wording inaccuracies missed by
the previous review-response commit.

### What changed

- **Real bug, confirmed by diffing against the pre-Chunk-17 source
  (`git show dab5cbd^:python/PreFit.py`) and fixed**: the original
  `Fit()` reused one `TStopwatch` for both phases, restarting it
  (`w.Reset(); w.Start()`) immediately after the sampling phase's own
  `w.Print()` - i.e. *before* the "Starting fit of %d best samples"
  banner and the `bestChi2`/`bestPars` buffer setup. After Chunk 17
  moved the sampling phase into `_select_best_parameter_sets()` (which
  now owns its own stopwatch), the fitting-phase stopwatch in `Fit()`
  was constructed and started *after* that banner and buffer setup
  instead - a small but real, observable timing-output regression
  (`w.Print()`'s reported interval no longer covers the same span).
  Moved the new stopwatch's construction/`Start()` back to immediately
  after `_select_best_parameter_sets()` returns, matching the original
  interval exactly. Verified with the real-ROOT fixture test that fit
  results (`bestPars`, `nbkg`) are unaffected, as expected (timing
  never entered any assertion).
- **Documentation-accuracy fixes** (no behavior change), all leftover
  from the previous review-response commit's "stub-free" -> "ROOT-stubbed"
  pass: `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s two remaining "ROOT-free" mentions
  (a cross-reference comment and a section-heading comment for the same
  two tests already described accurately a few lines below) renamed to
  "ROOT-stubbed" for internal consistency. `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s
  summary sentence claiming all five hot-path-support files "follow the
  same two-tier approach... a sys.modules-stubbed fast tier plus a
  real... tier" was checked against its own Test-file map and found
  false: `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` has no fast tier at all (every one
  of its tests is real-ROOT, confirmed - none of its 5
  `requires_analysis_dependencies`-marked tests print in the
  lightweight gate's dot output), and `createBinning.py`/
  `FindBHWindow.py`'s fast fragments are reached by deferred imports
  (ROOT-free / numpy-only respectively), not by `sys.modules["ROOT"]`
  stubbing. Rewrote the sentence to describe each file's actual shape
  instead of asserting a uniform pattern.

### Verification performed

- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 198 passed, 20
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- Real-ROOT: `python -m pytest tests/test_pre_fit.py -m
  "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v` (2 passed) - confirms the
  stopwatch reorder does not change `bestPars`/`nbkg`.
- Read `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py` directly to confirm its
  fast tier does use a `sys.modules["ROOT"]` stub (2 tests, the
  `GetNsig`/`GetNsigErr` falsiness-quirk regression), and confirmed via
  the lightweight gate's own dot-per-file output that
  `test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py` contributes zero dots (all 5 of its
  tests are `requires_analysis_dependencies`-marked, none fast) before
  rewriting the summary sentence.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` across all changed files: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `git diff --stat`: `python/PreFit.py`, `tests/test_pre_fit.py`,
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a second review-response pass over already-complete
work, not a new chunk.

## 2026-09-07 — Self-audit of the review-response commits: four accuracy defects found and fixed

### Objective
The user asked for a critical evaluation of the three preceding
2026-09-07 commits (`12a17e1`, `fde3006`, `b4b9d36`) - whether the
documentation actually matches the changes made, and whether those
changes were effective - rather than taking the commits' own
verification claims at face value. Effectiveness was confirmed by
re-running everything; four documentation/behaviour defects were found
in the process, three of them introduced or left behind by the very
commits meant to fix accuracy. This entry records both halves.

### Effectiveness re-verified (independently, not from prior claims)

- `bash scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: exit code 0, all six gates PASSED -
  lightweight (218 collected, 198 passed, 20 deselected, Ruff/Black
  clean); scientific runtime-readiness (1 passed, 2.13s); J100/J50
  scientific gate (1 passed, 71.34s); plotting-layer/hot-path real-ROOT
  gate (18 passed, 28 deselected, 46.70s); prepared-dependency gate (2
  passed, 14 deselected); `FindBHWindow.py` dedicated-interpreter gate
  (global p-value 0.0334, mask window 595,691). `git status --short`
  clean afterward. The runtime-readiness gate that `fde3006` added
  therefore does run, which was the point of that fix.
- The `tests/test_pre_fit.py` stub-order fix works: running
  `test_select_best_parameter_sets_ranks_and_bounds_output_and_is_deterministic`
  before `test_build_candidate_functions_returns_ten_linear_and_ten_log_candidates`
  by explicit node ID (the order that failed before the fix) now gives
  2 passed.
- The documented gate figures are exact, and the deselection count
  reconciles: 22 `requires_analysis_dependencies` markers exist across
  `tests/`, minus the 2 in `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`
  (deliberately absent from `scripts/quality_check.py`'s `test_targets`),
  giving the documented 20 deselected.
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s rewritten five-file fast-tier paragraph is
  accurate on tier *shape*: fast (unmarked) test counts per file are 6
  (`createBinning`), 11 (`FindBHWindow`), 2 (`ExtractFitParameters`), 0
  (`ExtractPostfitFromWS`), 2 (`PreFit`), and only
  `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py` and `tests/test_pre_fit.py`
  contain `sys.modules["ROOT"]` stubs.
- CI: `12a17e1`, `fde3006` and `b4b9d36` all concluded `success` (the
  last confirmed directly against its own run record, run
  34123857025, rather than from a polling script).

### What changed (the four defects)

- **`python/PreFit.py`: one line of stdout that the pre-refactor code
  never printed.** Chunk 17.B added a `print("==================")`
  between the sampling phase and the "Starting fit of %d best samples"
  banner. The pre-refactor `Fit()` went straight from the sampling
  phase's own `w.Print()` to that banner, printing exactly one divider
  for the whole transition - confirmed twice over, from
  `git show dab5cbd^:python/PreFit.py` and from the untouched
  near-duplicate `python/PreFitWS.py:119-127`, which still carries the
  original shape. Chunk 17's premise is verbatim behaviour
  preservation, and `b4b9d36` corrected the stopwatch placement *in
  this same region* without noticing the added line. Removed; the two
  files' `print(...)` sets are now identical. Nothing parses this
  output (checked across `.py`/`.sh`/`.cpp`), so the practical impact
  was cosmetic.
- **The "exactly what CI runs" claim was false, in four places.**
  `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`'s header, `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` and `README.md` all stated the
  script runs exactly what `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`
  runs. It does not: that workflow has five gate steps and no
  `FindBHWindow.py` dedicated-interpreter step, while the workflow in
  turn runs submodule-checkout, `install.sh --check`/`--build` and
  CVMFS-probe steps the script does not. Reworded all four to say the
  first five gates match and the script is a deliberate superset of the
  workflow's test gates. Also recorded, in the script's own header,
  that nothing enforces gate-*step* parity between script and workflow:
  the two `tests/test_repo_utils.py` coverage tests compare which test
  *files* each references, and `tests/test_find_bh_window.py` is
  already referenced by Gate 4, so deleting Gate 6 outright would not
  fail any test. This is the same class of gap Copilot found in
  `fde3006`, inverted.
- **Two stale gate enumerations missed by `fde3006`.** That commit
  added the runtime-readiness gate and updated
  `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s "three gates above" to "four", but
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s parallel "Runs every gate below in sequence -
  ..." list and `README.md`'s equivalent sentence both still enumerated
  the old five gates, omitting runtime-readiness. `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`
  also named the prepared-dependency gate as being "below" when that
  document has no such section. Both updated to six gates, with
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` now pointing at `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` for the
  two gates documented there rather than in it. `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`'s
  own enumeration was incomplete in the same way and was extended to
  six.
- **`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` overclaimed the `requires_root` marker, in
  two places.** `b4b9d36`'s rewrite fixed the false "all five share one
  `sys.modules`-stubbed fast tier" claim but carried over the old
  sentence's assertion that each file "pairs with the same real, marked
  `requires_root`+`requires_analysis_dependencies` ... tier".
  `tests/test_find_bh_window.py` has zero `requires_root` markers: its
  one marked test carries `requires_analysis_dependencies` alone, with
  a source comment at `tests/test_find_bh_window.py:324` stating why
  (`FindBHWindow.py` imports `uproot`/`pyBumpHunter`, never ROOT). The
  same overclaim appeared in the blanket sentence under the Test-file
  map ("Every real-ROOT/CVMFS-needing test above is marked both ..."),
  which also contradicted that map's own `FindBHWindow.py` row. Both
  rewritten to state the actual split - `requires_analysis_dependencies`
  on all of them, `requires_root` on the four that need ROOT - and the
  rewrite of the second one was checked to keep its following clause
  ("... is what keeps a test that sources `setup_buildAndFit.sh` out of
  the ordinary gate") pointing at the correct marker. Also fixed the
  first paragraph's "but only where a fast tier exists" clause, which
  read backwards: `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` has no fast tier yet does
  have the real, marked tier.

Deliberately **not** changed: the three preceding 2026-09-07 entries in
this file use `## <date> — <title>` while the 46 Tier-3 entries above
them use `## <date>: <title>`. Both styles already exist in this file's
history (the 2026-07 entries use the em dash), the record stays
accurate and readable either way, and per this file's own append-only
rule and the user's explicit instruction, existing entries are edited
only for serious typesetting or text-malformation problems - which this
is not. Nor were those entries edited to record the defects above; this
entry is the correction of record for all four.

### Verification performed

- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 198 passed, 20
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0 (which includes both
  gate-coverage tests - the new header text mentioning
  `tests/test_find_bh_window.py` sits in a full-line comment and is
  correctly stripped by `_strip_full_line_comments()`, so it creates no
  false-positive coverage).
- Real-ROOT: `python -m pytest tests/test_pre_fit.py -m
  "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`: 2 passed, 2 deselected, 6.06s -
  confirms removing the divider changes no assertion or result.
- `diff` of every `print("...")` string in `python/PreFit.py` against
  `git show dab5cbd^:python/PreFit.py`: identical sets.
- `bash -n scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: syntax OK.
- `grep` for any residual "exactly what `.github`"/"exactly the
  checks"/"every check `.github`" phrasing outside this log: none.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` across all changed files: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- `git diff --stat`: `README.md`, `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`, `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`, `python/PreFit.py`,
  `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`, `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a self-audit and accuracy-correction pass over
already-complete work, not a new chunk.

## 2026-09-07 — Address a third round of GitHub Copilot PR review findings (gate runner and its coverage tests)

### Objective
Respond to a third Copilot review round, which flagged three problems
with `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` and its two coverage tests: a
ROOT-independent gate trapped behind the ROOT-availability check, a
gate that duplicates another gate's coverage while proving less, and
coverage assertions that can pass on text that is not part of any
pytest command. Each was verified directly against the real files
before anything was changed; all three were real.

### What changed

- **Real gap, confirmed and fixed: the prepared-dependency gate was
  skipped whenever ROOT setup failed.** It sat inside the
  `else` branch of the ROOT-availability check, yet its two tests
  (`tests/test_repo_utils.py`'s
  `test_external_dependency_checkouts_match_pinned_revisions` and
  `..._have_no_tracked_source_changes`) need no ROOT at all - read
  directly, they call `git -C <dir> rev-parse HEAD`, `git status
  --short --untracked-files=no` and `Path.is_dir()`, and nothing else.
  They carry `requires_analysis_dependencies` because they need the
  prepared *checkouts*, not a ROOT runtime. Leaving them behind that
  check contradicted the script's own documented
  "all gates still run - one broken gate doesn't hide another"
  contract, and let a missing CVMFS mount mask a genuine
  dependency-checkout failure. Moved it ahead of the ROOT check as
  Gate 2, invoked with the script's already-selected `$python_bin`
  rather than a sourced LCG Python. Proved by replacing
  `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` with a stub that fails: Gate 2
  PASSED while Gates 3-5 hard-failed, where previously it would not
  have run at all. The stub was then reverted and
  `git diff`/`git status` confirmed the file byte-identical to HEAD.
- **Real duplication, confirmed and removed: the "FindBHWindow.py
  dedicated-interpreter gate" ran exactly what another gate already
  ran.** Read against `tests/test_find_bh_window.py`'s own
  `_run_find_bh_window_script()` helper: that marked end-to-end test -
  which the plotting-layer gate already selects - sources the same
  setup script, exports the same
  `PYTHONPATH="$repo_dir/pyBumpHunter:$PYTHONPATH"`, invokes the same
  ambient `python3 python/FindBHWindow.py` against the same committed
  J100 `PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root` fixture with the same
  `--bkghist`/`--datahist` values, and additionally asserts
  `MaskMin == 595.0`, `MaskMax == 691.0`, `BlindRange == "595,691"`,
  the presence of `pyBHresult`, and both output PNGs. The separate gate
  asserted only an exit status, so it was strictly weaker as well as
  redundant. Its name was also a misnomer: it used the ambient
  interpreter, not the `pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env` one
  `run_masking.run_bumphunter()` actually invokes in production (that
  venv is confirmed broken here - missing `uproot` and `matplotlib` -
  and is already recorded under Known limitations). Removed; the script
  is now five gates, not six.
- **Consequence of the above, corrected in the same pass**: with the
  duplicate gate gone the script's five gates are once again exactly
  the five test gates `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`
  runs, so the "superset of that workflow's test gates" wording
  introduced in `5699336` (itself the fix for an earlier "exactly what
  CI runs" overclaim) is now obsolete. Reverted to a plain equality
  claim in all four places, each still noting that the workflow
  additionally runs submodule-checkout/`install.sh`/CVMFS-probe steps
  the script does not: `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`'s header,
  `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` and
  `README.md`.
- **Real false-positive path, confirmed and fixed (the suppressed
  finding): the coverage assertions searched whole-file text.** Both
  gate-coverage tests compared selectors and filenames against the
  entire comment-stripped file, so any occurrence - an `echo`, a
  workflow `name:`, a variable assignment, an unrelated shell block -
  satisfied them even after the real gate was deleted. Added
  `_pytest_command_lines()`, which strips full-line comments, joins
  backslash-continued lines into single logical lines, and keeps only
  those logical lines that actually invoke pytest (`_PYTEST_INVOCATION`
  matches `-m pytest` or a `pytest`/`.../bin/pytest` command word,
  deliberately not a bare "pytest" substring, which appears in prose
  and step names throughout both files). Both tests now assert against
  that text alone. Each also passes a `non_pytest_sentinel` -
  `"[run-all-gates]"` for the script, `"runs-on:"` for the workflow -
  a string the source really contains but only outside any pytest
  command; if it survives extraction the test fails immediately, so a
  future over-permissive extractor cannot silently make every
  assertion vacuous.
  Proved in both directions. Sabotage: deleted Gate 3's real pytest
  invocation while leaving `authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime`
  behind in an `echo` line. The new test failed with
  `is missing a dedicated selector for these ... tests:
  ['test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime']`, while the
  old substring logic, run against that same sabotaged file, reported
  the selector "present" and would have passed - its only occurrence
  being the echo line. Negative control: monkeypatching
  `_pytest_command_lines` to return all non-comment text made the
  sentinel assertion fire as designed. The script was then restored and
  re-verified.
- **Documentation**: the gate count went six -> five in
  `README.md`, `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` and `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`, with
  the two ROOT-free gates now described as always running first.
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s `### FindBHWindow.py dedicated-interpreter
  gate` section became `### FindBHWindow.py manual reproduction command
  (not a separate gate)`: the command is retained, because it is still
  the useful hand-runnable form for debugging, but the section now
  states plainly that the *automated* proof is
  `tests/test_find_bh_window.py`'s marked test (run by the
  plotting-layer gate and by CI), that the script deliberately does not
  run the command as a gate, and that neither route exercises the
  production `pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env` interpreter. Three further
  references to it as a "gate" - in the gate-coverage summary, the
  Known-limitations entry, and the Completion definition - were
  repointed to that test.

Deliberately **not** changed: `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s Chunk 18
instruction to "Add the new `FindBHWindow.py` dedicated-interpreter gate
command" records the plan as approved and executed, and the command it
refers to still exists (renamed); rewriting a completed plan's own
instructions to match a later refactor would misrepresent what was
planned. This file's earlier entries describing a six-gate script are
likewise left unedited per its append-only rule - they were accurate
when written, and this entry is the correction of record.

### Verification performed

- `bash scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: exit code 0, all five gates PASSED -
  lightweight (198 passed, 20 deselected); prepared-dependency (2
  passed, 14 deselected, run before the ROOT check under the dev venv);
  scientific runtime-readiness (1 passed, 2.56s); J100/J50 scientific
  gate (1 passed, 72.45s); plotting-layer/hot-path real-ROOT gate (18
  passed, 28 deselected, 50.44s).
- ROOT-failure simulation (stubbed `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`):
  Gate 2 PASSED, Gates 3-5 reported the hard ROOT failure, script
  exited 1; stub reverted and the file confirmed byte-identical to
  HEAD. Gate 1 also failed in that simulation, as expected - the
  lightweight gate contains its own test asserting that file's
  authoritative content - which is itself a useful confirmation that
  the file is guarded.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 198 passed, 20
  deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- Both sabotage/negative-control experiments above, then restore and
  re-run: `tests/test_repo_utils.py` 14 passed, 2 deselected.
- `bash -n scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: syntax OK; file mode still 755.
- `grep` for residual "dedicated-interpreter gate"/"six gates"/"Gate 6"
  outside this log and `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`: none.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` across all changed files: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- CI: `5699336` (the preceding self-audit commit) concluded `success`.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a third review-response pass over already-complete work,

## 2026-09-07 — Address a fourth round of GitHub Copilot PR review findings (gate extractor anchoring, vacuous ranking assertions)

### Objective
Respond to a fourth Copilot review round: the pytest-command extractor
added in `2e03d2c` was unanchored and therefore still accepted echoed
commands - the exact false positive it was introduced to prevent - and
`tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s ranking test scored every trial identically,
making its ranking assertions vacuous. Both were verified empirically
before anything changed; both were real.

### What changed

- **Real false positive, confirmed and fixed: `_PYTEST_INVOCATION` was
  unanchored.** The previous pattern
  `(?:-m\s+pytest|(?:^|[\s/])pytest)(?:\s|$)` searched anywhere in a
  logical line, so
  `echo "python -m pytest tests/test_pre_fit.py -v"` and a workflow
  `- name:` mentioning the command both matched. The sabotage
  experiment run for `2e03d2c` happened not to expose this because the
  echo it inserted (`skipping authoritative_setup...`) contained no
  `-m pytest`; a fuller sabotage does. Reproduced directly: deleted
  Gate 3's real invocation from `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` and left the
  *entire* command text inside an `echo`. The old pattern classified
  that echo as a pytest command, so the coverage check would still have
  reported the gate covered; the new anchored pattern makes the test
  fail with
  `missing a dedicated selector ... ['test_authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime']`.
  Replaced with a pattern anchored at the command position of the
  logical line, accepting `python`/`python3`/`python3.9`,
  `/path/to/python`, `"$python_bin"`, a bare `pytest`/`.../bin/pytest`,
  and any of those behind this script's own `run_gate "<description>"`
  wrapper. Verified against both real files: 4 pytest invocations
  matched in `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` and 4 in
  `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` - every real one, no
  echoes.
- **Added the echo-line regression test Copilot asked for**:
  `test_pytest_command_lines_ignores_echoed_commands()` asserts
  `_pytest_command_lines()` returns nothing for a block containing an
  `echo`ed command, a single-quoted `echo`, a commented-out command, a
  `step_name=` assignment and a `printf`, and that all five genuine
  invocation shapes are still recognised with backslash continuations
  joined. This pins the helper's contract directly rather than leaving
  it to a manual sabotage experiment.
- **Real vacuous assertion, confirmed and fixed: every trial in the
  ranking test scored identically.** `_FakeCandidateTF1.Integral()`
  returned a constant `1.0`, and `_select_best_parameter_sets()` calls
  `Integral()` and then overwrites parameters 0-9 with fixed values
  (`p0`, 80, 10, ...) before scoring - so `p0 = Exp(integral/1.0)` was
  constant and the summed-abs-params score was identical for all 30
  trials. Measured directly before the fix: **1 distinct score across
  30 trials** (92.71828...), and all five returned parameter arrays
  identical. `chi2_values == sorted(chi2_values)` was therefore
  trivially true, and an implementation keeping any five duplicates
  would have passed. Fixed at the root cause: `Integral()` now depends
  on the current parameters, as ROOT's real `TF1::Integral` does - and
  since `_select_best_parameter_sets()` calls it while the parameters
  are still the freshly randomized ones, `p0` is in fact the only
  channel through which each trial's randomization reaches the score at
  all. Measured after: **30 distinct scores across 30 trials**.
- **Strengthened the ranking assertions to match.** The test now spies
  on every score handed out and asserts: all `nRetries1` scores are
  distinct (guarding the test's own premise, with an explicit failure
  message naming the vacuousness if they ever collapse again); the
  returned chi2 list equals `sorted(observed_scores)[:nRetries2]`
  exactly, not merely "is sorted"; each retained parameter array
  belongs to its own recorded chi2 (`pars[0] == chi2 - 90`, since the
  scorer returns `|p0| + |80| + |10|` and the loop writes exactly 80
  and 10 into parameters 1 and 2 before scoring); and all five arrays
  are distinct. The determinism half additionally asserts the whole
  observed score sequence reproduces.
- **Added the scripted-sequence test Copilot suggested as the
  alternative**:
  `test_select_best_parameter_sets_keeps_the_exact_minima_of_a_scripted_score_sequence()`
  feeds a known, deliberately unsorted 12-value sequence - global
  maximum first, global minimum last, so "keep the first N" and "keep
  the last N" are both ruled out - and asserts the returned four chi2
  values are exactly `[1.0, 3.0, 3.5, 8.0]`, plus that `score_fn` was
  called exactly `nRetries1` times. This checks the extracted
  `bisect.insort`/`pop` bookkeeping against values chosen in advance
  rather than against whatever the seeded randomization produced.
- **Refreshed every gate figure the two new tests changed**, since
  leaving them would have re-introduced exactly the staleness audited
  earlier today: lightweight gate `218 collected/198 passed` ->
  `220 collected/200 passed` in `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` and
  `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`; prepared-dependency gate `2 passed, 14
  deselected` -> `15 deselected`; the plotting-layer files' unfiltered
  count `46` -> `47` and its marker-filtered `28 deselected` -> `29`;
  and the per-gate timings to this run's real measurements (2.27s
  runtime-readiness, 74.68s scientific, 59.06s unfiltered
  plotting-layer). The `47 passed` figure was re-measured for real
  under a sourced CVMFS/LCG runtime rather than inferred from the
  collection count.

### Verification performed

- `bash scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: exit code 0, all five gates PASSED -
  lightweight (200 passed, 20 deselected); prepared-dependency (2
  passed, 15 deselected); scientific runtime-readiness (1 passed,
  2.27s); J100/J50 scientific gate (1 passed, 74.68s);
  plotting-layer/hot-path real-ROOT gate (18 passed, 29 deselected,
  51.55s).
- Real-ROOT, unfiltered: the plotting-layer gate's 8 files with no `-m`
  filter - 47 passed in 59.06s.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 220 collected, 200
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- Empirical before/after on the ranking test: 1 distinct score in 30
  trials before, 30 distinct after; the retained five confirmed equal
  to the five smallest observed, with `pars[0] == chi2 - 90` holding
  for each.
- Echo-form sabotage reproduced and the old pattern shown to accept it,
  the new pattern shown to reject it, then `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`
  restored and confirmed identical to its committed state.
- Anchored pattern checked against both real files: 4 genuine pytest
  invocations matched in each, no echo or step-name lines.
- `grep` for residual `218`/`198 passed`/`14 deselected`/`28
  deselected`/`46 passed`/`2.62`/`73.22` outside this log: none.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` across all changed files: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- CI: `2e03d2c` (the preceding commit) concluded `success`.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a fourth review-response pass over already-complete work,
not a new chunk.

## 2026-09-07 — Fix a fourth, never-cited copy of Chunk 17's "no ROOT calls of its own" claim

### Objective
While walking back through each Copilot review comment one by one with
the user, tracing the origin of round 1's "no ROOT calls of its
own"/"stub-free" claim turned up a copy that no review round ever cited
and that all four previous response passes therefore missed.

### What changed

- `git grep "no ROOT calls of its own" 34315d1` showed the claim stood
  in **four** places when round 1 reviewed the branch:
  `python/PreFit.py:171` (cited), `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md:219` (cited),
  `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md:9490` (cited), and
  `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md:1879` (**never cited**). The first two
  were corrected in `fde3006`; the activity-log copy is left as written
  per this file's append-only rule. The plan-document copy - the Chunk
  17 design table's cell for `_select_best_parameter_sets` - survived
  untouched through all four review-response commits.
- Root cause of the miss: the sweep after round 1 grepped for
  `stub-free` (which reached 0 occurrences outside this log) but never
  for the *other* half of the same false claim, `no ROOT calls of its
  own`. Copilot cited three of the four sites and the fourth was
  assumed absent rather than checked. This is the same
  fix-the-citation-not-the-class scoping failure that made round 2
  revisit `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s lines 28/187 after round 1 fixed
  only the cited line 189.
- Corrected that cell to state the actual property - histogram scoring
  injected through the caller's `h.Chisquare(...)` closure, so the
  method never touches the data histogram directly, while still calling
  `ROOT.TStopwatch`/`ROOT.TMath` for timing and the `Exp`/`Log`
  initial-guess math - and noted inline that the cell originally
  predicted "no ROOT calls of its own", which the implementation showed
  to be wrong. The prediction is kept visible rather than silently
  overwritten, since this document records a design that was reviewed
  and approved before implementation; unlike Chunk 18's
  `FindBHWindow.py` gate instruction (deliberately left as the plan of
  record, since it was executed faithfully and only later refactored),
  this cell asserted a *property of the code* that was never true, and
  the same document's Chunk 17 Step B prose had already been corrected
  for the identical error - leaving one half corrected and the other
  half false was the worse option.
- Swept for every related phrasing rather than just this one, to avoid
  a fifth pass: `no ROOT calls`, `ROOT-independent`, `without ROOT`,
  `zero ROOT`, `never touches ROOT`, plus every line mentioning
  `_select_best_parameter_sets`. All remaining hits were verified
  accurate - `createBinning.py`'s `parse_args()`/`resolve_bin_edges()`,
  `plotPostFit.py`'s `parse_args()`, `FindBHWindow.py`'s `parse_args()`
  and `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s `_score_by_summed_abs_params()`
  docstring all genuinely make no ROOT calls. The Chunk 17 row at
  `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md:403` was checked and makes no
  ROOT-independence claim.

### Verification performed

- `grep -rn "no ROOT calls of its own"` outside `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`:
  the only remaining occurrence is the phrase quoted inside the
  correction note itself.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 220 collected, 200
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`: clean.
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- Documentation-only change; no source, test or gate behaviour touched.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-07 — Generalise each Copilot finding to its class; two sister defects and two missing guards found

### Objective
The user asked whether the thirteen Copilot findings had undiscovered
root causes or sister instances - explicitly warning against assuming a
file is correct because it has not been edited recently, or that a
comment about one line cannot apply elsewhere. Each finding was
therefore generalised to a defect *class* and the class searched for
across the whole repository.

### What changed

Two sister defects, both real and both in tests never touched by any
review round:

- **`test_git_hook_pre_commit_gate_matches_authoritative_commands`
  false-passed.** It asserted the mandatory local gate's commands by
  searching `.githooks/pre-commit`'s raw text. Proved by commenting the
  hook's *entire* scientific gate out: the test still passed. This is
  Comment 3's defect on the repository's most load-bearing check.
- **`test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate` false-passed.** Same
  cause. Proved by commenting the lightweight-gate command out of
  `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml`: the test still passed,
  so CI could stop running the gate with no test objecting.

Both now assert through a new `_executable_command_lines()` helper -
full-line comments dropped, backslash continuations joined, pure-output
lines (`echo`/`printf`/`cat`) and heredoc bodies removed - and the
pytest assertions go through the existing `_pytest_command_lines()`.
`_strip_full_line_comments()`/`_join_continuations()` were hoisted so
all three helpers share one implementation. The *negative* assertions
(`"requires_root" not in workflow`) deliberately stay against raw text:
for a must-not-appear check, raw text is the stricter side, since it
also rejects a commented-out mention. Added
`test_executable_command_lines_ignores_comments_and_echoes()`, which
itself found a gap in the first version of the helper (heredoc bodies
carry no command word to filter on) before that version was committed.

Two missing guards, both being the reason earlier findings escaped:

- **No test captured any hot-path script's console output.** Chunk
  17.A's characterization test pinned only `(bestPars, nbkg)` and
  determinism, so Chunk 17.B's two stdout/timing changes - the
  stopwatch moved after the banner, and an added `==================`
  divider - were invisible to every gate and were caught only by review
  and by hand-diffing git history. Added a console-output assertion to
  that test: `"Finished sampling"` must be immediately preceded by one
  divider and immediately followed by the "Starting fit" banner.
  Verified it catches the historical defect by re-introducing the
  divider - the test fails; removed again.
- **`resolve_bin_edges()`'s fake `.Eval()` returned a constant**, so no
  test could see *which* x the production loop evaluates: passing a
  bin's upper edge instead of its lower edge would have produced
  identical output. Added a recording fake asserting the evaluation
  points equal the returned edges except the last, and verified it
  fails under a deliberate `Eval(bin_edge + 1)` mutation.

Verified clean, so no change made:

- Every `requires_root` test also carries
  `requires_analysis_dependencies` (a test with only the former would
  run in the lightweight gate and fail in CVMFS-less CI).
- All five Step-B extractions preserve their `print()` call multisets,
  compared by AST rather than regex - an initial regex sweep reported a
  false difference on `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` because the
  pre-extraction file wrote `print (` with a space, which Black later
  normalised.
- Chunk 16a's Python-2 `.values()[-1]` indexing and Chunk 16b's
  key-vs-value `next(iter(dict))` pattern appear nowhere else in
  hot-path code; all eight `ExtractPostfitFromWS` accessors now use
  `.values()`.
- All 48 function/method names in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s module-map
  rows exist in the sources they describe (checked by AST).
- `python/PreFitWS.py` and `python/run_nloFit.py` are unreachable from
  the J100/J50 launchers, and `PreFitWS.PreFitter` takes a
  workspace-based constructor with no `parRangeLow`/`nPars`, so it does
  not share `PreFit.py`'s 7-vs-10-element fragility. It is a structural
  sibling of `Fit()`'s sampling block, not a whole-file duplicate.
- The installer policy tests already strip comments and use negative
  assertions, which is sound. Notably that correct technique was
  already present in `tests/test_repo_utils.py` before Comment 3 was
  raised and was not reused.

Flagged, not changed: `python/createExtractionGraph_signalInjection.py:337`
has a live `list(next(iter(list(dict_file.items()))))[0]` - the same
key-vs-value shape as Chunk 16b's bug. That file is outside Tier 3's
scope and unreachable from the J100/J50 launchers, and the intent of
that line has not been verified, so it is recorded here rather than
altered.

Gate figures refreshed for the two new tests: lightweight 222
collected/202 passed/20 deselected; prepared-dependency 2 passed/16
deselected; plotting-layer files 48 unfiltered (51.20s, re-measured
under a real CVMFS runtime, not inferred).

### Verification performed

- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 222 collected, 202
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- Real-ROOT `tests/test_pre_fit.py -m requires_analysis_dependencies`:
  2 passed.
- Unfiltered plotting-layer files under real ROOT: 48 passed, 51.20s.
- Four sabotage/restore experiments, each failing before the fix and
  after re-breaking, then restored and confirmed clean: hook scientific
  gate commented out; CI gate command commented out; PreFit divider
  re-introduced; `Eval(bin_edge + 1)` mutation.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Remaining open chunks

## 2026-09-07 — Address a fifth round of GitHub Copilot PR review findings (YAML metadata treated as executable)

### Objective
Respond to a fifth Copilot review round, raised against
`tests/test_repo_utils.py`'s `_executable_command_lines()` - code
committed thirty-four minutes earlier in `ffd6b92`, the commit whose
whole purpose was to fix this defect class in two other tests. Rated
High, and correct.

### What changed

- **Real false positive, confirmed and fixed.** The helper filters
  shell lines: comments, `echo`/`printf`/`cat`, heredoc bodies. A
  GitHub Actions workflow is YAML, so most of its lines are metadata,
  and a step's `name:` is free text. `- name: python
  scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` carries no output-only command
  word, so it survived every filter and satisfied the assertion.
  Reproduced end to end: deleting the real `run:` command from
  `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml` while moving its text
  into the step's `name:` left
  `test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate` passing.
- Added `_workflow_run_block_lines()`, which returns only the contents
  of a workflow's `run:` blocks - block scalars by indentation, plus
  inline `run: <command>` - and routed both workflow-reading tests
  through it before any command search. This is Copilot's primary
  suggestion; the alternative it offered (excluding YAML keys
  generically) would also have dropped inline `run:` commands.
- Moved the scientific-workflow coverage test's negative-control
  sentinel from `"runs-on:"` to `"set -o pipefail"`. The old sentinel
  sits in YAML metadata, which the new restriction discards, so it
  would have been trivially absent and the control vacuous. The new one
  is a real command inside a `run:` block that is not a pytest
  invocation, so it still proves the extractor excludes non-pytest
  commands.
- Added `test_workflow_run_block_lines_excludes_yaml_metadata()`,
  asserting that a block of `name:`/`uses:`/`with:`/`env:` lines
  extracts to nothing, while a block scalar's contents and an inline
  `run:` command both survive.

### Why this was not caught in `ffd6b92`

The sabotage used to sign that commit off commented the gate command
out but left the step name alone. The workflow's real step name is
"Run complete lightweight quality gate", which does not contain the
command text, so the test failed and the fix looked proven. The
adversarial case - delete the command *and* put its text where a
surviving line will carry it - was not tried.

This is the second time in this cycle that a verification was shaped so
the weak spot went unexercised: the same thing happened one round
earlier, when the echo used to prove the pytest parser contained no
`-m pytest` and so was the one echo the unanchored pattern rejected.
Both times a green result was reported as evidence the mechanism
worked. The corrective taken here is to keep the adversarial case in a
committed regression test rather than in a one-off experiment, which is
now done for all three helpers.

### Verification performed

- Four sabotage cases, each failing as it should and then restored:
  (1) CI gate command deleted with its text moved into the step
  `name:` - the case that previously passed; (2) the same command
  merely commented out - the previously-fixed case, still caught;
  (3) `tests/test_pre_fit.py` dropped from the scientific workflow's
  `run:` block while a step name mentions it; (4) the pre-commit hook's
  scientific gate commented out.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 223 collected, 203
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- Gate figures refreshed accordingly (lightweight 223/203;
  prepared-dependency 2 passed, 17 deselected).
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Remaining open chunks

None. This is a fifth review-response pass over already-complete work,
not a new chunk.

## 2026-09-07 — Apply the executable-text standard to every remaining policy assertion

### Objective
The user asked that all tests be brought up to the standard established
over the last five review rounds, so the same defect class cannot be
reported a sixth time. The class: a test asserts a property of a file
by searching its raw text, where a match from an inert position - a
comment, a step name, a label - satisfies the assertion while the real
thing is gone.

### What changed

Every positive assertion of this shape in `tests/` was enumerated by
AST rather than by eye: find variables assigned from `read_text()`, then
find `assert "<literal>" in <that variable>`. Fifty-three remained, in
three groups.

- **The two installer policy tests (47 assertions).**
  `test_install_script_is_non_destructive` and
  `test_pybumphunter_installer_is_non_destructive_and_reproducible`
  asserted against raw `installer_text`, so a comment mentioning
  `verify_parent_gitlink`, `cmake --build`, `--no-deps` or any expected
  log message satisfied the check after the real line was removed. Each
  now reads `active_script`, the comment-stripped text those same tests
  already compute two lines above for their *negative* assertions -
  the correct variable was present and simply unused. Comment-stripping
  is the right strength here rather than `_executable_command_lines()`,
  because several of these assertions deliberately target `echo`
  message strings, which that helper removes.
- **The CI workflow's five configuration assertions.** `uses:`,
  `python-version:`, `requirements-dev-lock.txt` and `tier-2-m365` were
  searched in raw YAML, so a comment or a step `name:` quoting a pinned
  value satisfied them. Added `_yaml_config_lines()`, which strips
  full-line comments, strips trailing `# ...` comments respecting
  quotes, and drops every `name:` line, then routed those five through
  it. `pyyaml` is not in the locked development environment, so the
  workflow cannot be parsed properly; this is the strongest check
  available without adding a dependency, and it closes both inert
  positions that actually exist in these files.
- **The dependency-marker detector.** `_dependency_marked_test_names()`
  matched one exact spelling of the decorator line, so
  `@pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies()` - equally valid -
  would not have been recognised, letting a marked test exist with no
  gate selecting it and the per-test map guard still passing. Replaced
  with `_DEPENDENCY_MARKER`, accepting the bare and parenthesised
  forms and tolerating a trailing comment, while still rejecting a
  commented-out marker, a `pytestmark` assignment, and a
  longer-suffixed name. The file-level filter is left deliberately
  over-inclusive, which errs toward a false failure rather than a false
  pass, and now says so.

Two regression tests were added -
`test_yaml_config_lines_excludes_comments_and_step_names()` and
`test_dependency_marker_is_recognised_however_it_is_written()` - so
these properties are pinned by committed tests rather than by whichever
sabotage happens to be tried. That is the corrective for the specific
recurring mistake in this cycle: twice, a verification was shaped so the
weak spot went unexercised, and the passing result was reported as proof.

Judged out of class, unchanged: `tests/test_find_bh_window.py:359`
(`"pyBHresult" in result` is a dict-key check on parsed JSON, not a text
search - a false positive of the AST sweep) and
`tests/test_run_templates.py:210` (a substring check on a file the code
under test *generates*, where no "someone disabled a check" path
exists; it is a weaker assertion than checking the exact field, but a
different concern).

### Verification performed

- Each of the three groups sabotaged by planting the searched text in
  the inert position after removing the real one, and each test
  confirmed to fail: `tier-2-m365` left only in a workflow comment;
  `verify_parent_gitlink` left only in an `install.sh` comment;
  `--no-deps` left only in an `install_pyBumpHunter.sh` comment. All
  three files restored afterwards.
- The old logic was re-run against those same three sabotages and
  confirmed to return a match in every case - so each really would have
  passed before this change, rather than being assumed to.
- Re-ran the AST enumeration afterwards: **0 positive raw-text
  assertions remain** across every file in `tests/`.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 225 collected, 205
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean, exit code 0.
- Gate figures refreshed (lightweight 225/205; prepared-dependency
  2 passed, 19 deselected).
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-08 — Address a sixth round of Copilot review findings (a stale scientific-gate figure), and make figure drift a test failure

### Objective

Copilot (Low) reported that `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` still records the
scientific gate as **182.11 seconds** in two places (lines 46 and 385)
while `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` and `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`
record the later rerun as **74.68 seconds**, making the current
reference documentation self-contradictory within one pull request.
Confirm it, fix it, and stop the class rather than the two citations.

### What changed

- **Confirmed and fixed.** `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` is append-only, so
  entry order settles which figure is later: 182.11s is recorded at
  line 9563, and the 74.68s rerun at line 10742. No scientific-gate
  timing is recorded after it. So 74.68s is the latest measurement and
  both `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` citations were stale. Both updated.
- **Why it was missed.** The commit that produced the 74.68s
  measurement did grep for residual figures - but for `73.22` and
  `2.62`, the values *it* had superseded. It never grepped `182.11`,
  a figure written down two commits earlier and superseded by the same
  rerun. The check was aimed at the numbers in front of it rather than
  at every number the new measurement replaced. This is the third time
  in this pull request that a gate figure has been updated in some
  documents and left stale in another.
- **Made the class a test failure**, since three rounds of careful
  greppping have not held: added
  `test_documented_gate_figures_agree_across_every_living_document`
  and its `_documented_gate_runtimes()` helper. The helper flattens a
  document (backslash continuations removed, whitespace collapsed,
  because every one of these commands is wrapped and each document
  wraps at a different column), finds each recorded
  `N passed[, N deselected], T seconds` result, and attributes it to
  the nearest gate command printed above it. The test then requires
  every gate's runtime, and the lightweight gate's collected-test
  count, to be identical across all six living documents.
- The test also fails if a recorded runtime appears above every known
  gate command, so documenting a new gate forces its command into
  `_GATE_MARKERS` instead of leaving the figure silently unchecked;
  and it fails if no scientific or runtime-readiness figure is found at
  all, so a rewording cannot quietly make it vacuous.
- Deliberately not covered, and why: `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` and
  `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` are excluded, since both record what
  was measured at a point in time and are *supposed* to hold
  superseded figures; and the check compares documents against each
  other, not against a live run, so it catches drift between copies
  rather than all four copies aging together.

### Verification performed

- Three sabotages, each confirmed to fail the new test: restoring
  `182.11` on `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` line 385 alone (the exact defect
  Copilot reported); changing one document's `225 collected` to `220`;
  and inserting a recorded runtime above any gate command. All three
  restored afterwards, `git diff --stat` confirming only the intended
  files changed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 227 collected, 207
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0.
- Gate figures refreshed for the two new tests: lightweight
  `225 collected/205 passed` -> `227 collected/207 passed` in
  `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` and `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` -
  and the new test now enforces that those copies agree.
- CI for `0daa75e`: "Complete lightweight and scientific test suite"
  completed, conclusion **success**.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Noted, not changed

- `.venv/bin/python` now reports **Python 3.12.14**, while the
  documented development baseline and both CI workflows pin 3.12.13.
  The three pinned tools still match exactly (pytest 9.1.1, Ruff
  0.16.0, Black 26.5.1), and CI remains internally consistent, so this
  is a local interpreter patch bump rather than a documentation error;
  changing the CI pins is a separate decision and was not made here.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-08 — Audit every recorded gate figure across the documentation, and verify the ROOT-free counts by measurement

### Objective

Check every recorded selected-test count, outcome and timing in every
document for consistency, and make them consistent. `ACTIVITY_LOG.md`
is append-only, so its figures are history and were not touched.

### What changed

- **Extracted every figure mechanically** rather than by reading:
  13 "Latest ..." claims across four documents, plus two historical
  ones in `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`. No figures exist in
  `README.md`, the workflows, or `scripts/`.
- **Re-measured all five gates in one pass** (`bash
  scripts/run_all_gates.sh`, exit 0, all five PASSED), plus the
  plotting-layer gate a second time with no `-m` filter, so every
  documented figure comes from one coherent set of runs.
- **Four figures were stale against reality**, all corrected:
  prepared-dependency `19` -> `22` deselected; runtime readiness
  `2.27s` -> `3.69s`; scientific `74.68s` -> `134.41s`; plotting-layer
  marker-filtered `29` -> `30` deselected.
- **One documented figure was impossible, provable from the document
  alone**: the plotting-layer gate recorded 48 collected with 18
  selected and 29 deselected, which sums to 47. A test file had gained
  a test and only the total was refreshed. That section now records
  both variants of the gate separately - 48 collected/18 passed/30
  deselected/132.61s under the marker filter, and 48 passed/66.82s
  without it - since they are two different runs with legitimately
  different figures.
- **`doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` Section 5 contradicted Section 2 of
  the same document**, which is worse than a stale number: its closing
  paragraph still said `createBinning.py` "still has no decomposition
  into functions, no dedicated test file, and is still unregistered in
  `quality_check.py`", all three of which Chunk 13 changed. Its figures
  (289.19s, 172 passed) are a true record of the 2026-09-04 run that
  fixed that file's syntax error, so they were **not** rewritten; the
  block is now marked as measured then, and the contradicting
  present-tense claims are past tense with a pointer to Section 2.
- **Rewrote yesterday's figure-consistency test, which had two holes
  this audit exposed.** It compared only timings and collected counts,
  so the `19` -> `22` count drift was outside its scope entirely; and
  its runtime pattern required the word "seconds", so
  `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`'s `289.19s` never matched it. It now
  compares collected/passed/selected/deselected/expected-failures/
  seconds/files-unchanged, and matches both `74.68 seconds` and
  `289.19s`.
- **Scoped that test to claims introduced by the word "Latest"**, which
  is the real line between "this is the current result", which every
  document has to agree on, and "this is what that run measured", which
  must not be rewritten - the same reason this log is append-only. Each
  claim is also cut at the `exit code N` it ends with, so prose
  explaining a figure cannot be read back as part of it.
- **Added an arithmetic check**: where a gate records collected, passed
  and deselected, passed plus deselected must equal collected. This is
  the only check that catches a stale figure from one document alone,
  with nothing to compare against and nothing re-run - and it is
  exactly the plotting-layer defect above.
- **Added `test_documented_gate_counts_match_a_real_collection`**,
  which collects the two ROOT-free gates for real and compares the
  counts to what the documents claim. This is the only check that
  catches a count gone stale in *every* copy at once, or in the single
  document that records one - the prepared-dependency `19` was stale in
  the only place it appears, so no cross-document check could ever have
  found it. The gate's target list is read out of
  `scripts/quality_check.py` by AST, so dropping a file from the gate
  fails this test too.
- Timings are deliberately compared between documents but never
  measured: the scientific gate has taken 74.68s, 131.40s and 134.41s
  on this shared node for identical work, so a recorded timing is an
  observation, not a property. Attempting to verify one would make the
  suite fail on machine load.

### Verification performed

- Six sabotages, each restored afterwards. Caught: a cross-document
  timing disagreement written in the abbreviated `99.99s` form; counts
  changed *consistently* in all three documents to a total that cannot
  add up; the original 48/18/29 plotting-layer defect; the
  prepared-dependency count stale in its only copy; the lightweight
  count stale in all four copies at once; and a test file deleted from
  `scripts/quality_check.py`'s target list.
- Two of those six passed against the first version of the rewritten
  test and were only caught after fixing the seconds pattern and adding
  the real-collection check - both recorded here because the first
  version was reported as covering them.
- `bash scripts/run_all_gates.sh`: exit code 0, all five gates PASSED -
  lightweight (227 collected, 207 passed, 20 deselected, 2.01s);
  prepared-dependency (2 passed, 21 deselected); runtime readiness (1
  passed, 3.69s); J100/J50 scientific (1 passed, 134.41s);
  plotting-layer marker-filtered (18 passed, 30 deselected, 132.61s).
- Plotting-layer unfiltered, same sourced runtime: 48 passed, 66.82s.
- The lightweight and prepared-dependency counts documented now are
  `228 collected/208 passed/20 deselected` and `24 collected/2
  passed/22 deselected`, measured *after* the two new tests were added,
  which is why they exceed the gate-pass figures above by two. No other
  documented figure is affected by those two tests.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 228 collected, 208
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0.
- CI for `3c7e4b2`: "Complete lightweight and scientific test suite"
  conclusion **success**.
- `grep` for every superseded figure (`51.20`, `2.27 seconds`, `74.68`,
  `19 deselected`, `29 deselected`, `227 collected`, `207 passed`,
  `182.11`) outside this log: one deliberate hit, the timing-variance
  illustration in `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-08 — Re-read every Copilot review comment on PR 19 as a set, and fix the two remaining raw-text policy checks it never reached

### Objective

The individual review rounds were each answered as they arrived. This
pass fetched every comment Copilot has left on
`tofitsch/FrequentistFramework` PR 19 — 16 inline comments across five
reviews, plus the 8 "suppressed" comments that appear only inside the
review summaries and are never posted inline — and checked all 24
against the current tree rather than against the commit messages that
claimed to have answered them.

### What the audit found

- All 24 findings are addressed in `0d3c853`. The 8 suppressed ones
  were checked individually, since a suppressed comment is easy to miss:
  the two most substantive were `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s "all five
  scripts use a stubbed fast tier" claim (now states plainly that the
  fast tiers are three different shapes and that
  `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` has none) and `tests/test_pre_fit.py`'s
  20-formula coverage claim (now narrowed to the one form the real-ROOT
  test actually fits).
- Copilot's sixth review, on `0d3c853`, returned "unable to review …
  the user who requested the review has reached their quota limit". The
  latest commit — the figure-consistency audit and its three new tests —
  has therefore never been reviewed. Recorded here because the absence
  of comments on it is a quota artefact, not a clean bill of health.
- Copilot raised the same defect class five separate times: an
  assertion that searches a file's raw text cannot prove the file
  *runs* anything. Following the standing instruction not to treat an
  unreviewed file as clean, every remaining raw-text policy assertion
  in `tests/test_repo_utils.py` was swept for that class, and two
  instances were found in tests no review round ever reached. Both were
  confirmed by sabotage before being touched.

### What changed

- `_shell_invocation_lines()`: `_executable_command_lines()` with shell
  function *definition* lines removed. A function's definition carries
  its own name, so `"run_check" in executable_lines` was satisfied by
  `run_check() {` alone. Replacing both of `install.sh`'s real
  `run_check` calls with `echo "would run run_check here"` left
  `test_install_script_is_non_destructive` passing. Six assertions in
  the two installer tests (`run_check`, `setup_scientific_environment`,
  `verify_parent_gitlink`, `verify_no_tracked_changes`,
  `verify_roofit_extensions`, and the `--build)` dispatch's `run_build`)
  now go through it. The remaining assertions in those tests stay on
  comment-stripped text deliberately: they check message text, flags
  and filenames, which legitimately appear inside `echo`.
- `_declared_submodule_paths()`: reads `.gitmodules` through `git
  config --file … --get-regexp`, the way git itself reads it, instead
  of searching for `path = <name>`. Commenting out `path = quickFit`
  and renaming the real entry `quickFit-RENAMED` left
  `test_gitmodules_declares_expected_analysis_dependencies` passing,
  and no other test in the suite reads `.gitmodules` at all, so nothing
  else would have caught it.
- Two new regression tests pin both sabotages
  (`test_shell_invocation_lines_ignores_function_definitions_and_echoes`,
  `test_declared_submodule_paths_ignores_commented_out_declarations`).

### Verification performed

- Three sabotages, each restored afterwards, all confirmed **passing
  before** the change and **failing after**: the two `run_check` calls
  replaced by echoes; the `--build)` dispatch's `run_build` call
  replaced by an echo; the commented-out `.gitmodules` path.
- Both new regression tests were themselves sabotaged to confirm they
  are not vacuous: dropping the definition filter fails the first,
  reverting `_declared_submodule_paths()` to a raw-text scan fails the
  second. Restored, both pass.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 230 collected, 210
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0.
- The lightweight and prepared-dependency figures in the four
  documents that record them were updated to the values measured after
  these two tests were added — `230 collected/210 passed/20 deselected`
  and `26 collected/2 passed/24 deselected`. No ROOT gate's figures are
  affected: neither new test is marked
  `requires_analysis_dependencies`.
- CI for `0d3c853`: "Complete lightweight and scientific test suite"
  conclusion **success**.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Noted, not changed

- `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`'s earlier "stub-free" entries stay as written.
  Copilot flagged one directly (line 9514); this log is append-only and
  remains an accurate record of what was believed at the time, with the
  correction recorded in the later entry that made it.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-08 — Reflow a comment whose line wrap orphaned its verb (seventh Copilot review round)

### Objective

Copilot's seventh review (the quota limit that blocked the sixth having
cleared) raised one Low finding: `tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py`
"names only `GetH1Residuals()` even though the following block covers
six accessors", and asked for the "omitted accessor list" to be
restored.

### What the finding actually was

The diagnosis was wrong, but it was caused by a real defect.

- Nothing was omitted. All six accessors were named, across a list that
  wrapped between two lines - `GetNbins()/GetNpars()/GetNdof()/
  GetH1Chi2()/GetH1Postfit()/` on the first, `GetH1Residuals()` opening
  the second. Copilot's comment range began at the second of those
  lines, so it read the continuation as the whole sentence.
- Verified independently rather than merely rebutted: `7e6ff95`
  ("Chunk 16b: fix the 6-of-8 accessors' key-vs-value fallback bug")
  changed exactly `GetNbins`, `GetNpars`, `GetNdof`, `GetH1Chi2`,
  `GetH1Postfit` and `GetH1Residuals`. Six changed accessors, six names
  in the comment, six assertions below it. The comment was accurate.
- The real defect: the wrap orphaned a plural verb from its list, so
  the second line read alone as "GetH1Residuals() now correctly use
  next(iter(dict.values())) in their ..." - a singular subject with a
  plural verb, forming a sentence that looks complete and says
  something false. That is what misled the reviewer, and would mislead
  a person skimming from that line.

### What changed

- The comment is reflowed so its subject is "The six accessors Chunk
  16b fixed", stating the count up front, and no line reads as a
  standalone sentence. A closing line records that the six assertions
  below are one per fixed accessor, so the comment is self-checking
  against the block it describes. No assertion, and no production code,
  was touched.

### Generalised to the class

Every comment and document line in the repository ending in `/` - a
list continued onto the next line - was swept: 17 hits. Only this one
had the defect; in the rest the continuation either carries more list
items or reads correctly on its own. One was checked closely and
deliberately left as written: `tests/test_pre_fit.py:24`'s "Unlike
those two chunks' extractor classes" follows a list of *three* test
files, but "those two chunks" refers to Chunks 15 and 16 named earlier
in the same comment, and is correct.

### Verification performed

- `tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py -m
  "requires_analysis_dependencies"` under a sourced scientific runtime:
  5 passed, 21.91s. Run because the edited comment sits inside a
  snippet string that a real-ROOT subprocess executes, so a broken
  quote would be a real failure rather than a cosmetic one.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 230 collected, 210
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Collection counts unchanged - no test was added or removed,
  so no documented figure moved.
- CI for `eef3e33`: the fork's push-triggered "Complete lightweight and
  scientific test suite" concluded **success**; upstream PR 19's
  pull_request-triggered lightweight gate also **success**.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Noted, not changed

- The review reports "Files reviewed: 16/17 changed files". Which file
  went unexamined is not exposed by the API, so it is recorded here as
  unknown rather than guessed.
- The review's own header asks for "final human confirmation" of the
  scientific-runtime work. That is a request for maintainer sign-off,
  not a code finding, and remains open.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-08 — Correct Tier 3's global behavior-preservation claim, which the deliberate bug-fix chunks contradicted (eighth Copilot review round)

### Objective

Copilot's eighth review raised two suppressed findings, both on
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`: its opening claim that Tier 3 leaves "every
public entry point's external behavior preserved exactly" (line 6, and
again at line 12) and its Purpose statement's "never changing what any
of it computes" (line 14) are contradicted by Chunks 16a and 16b, which
changed public behavior on purpose. It asked for the actual policy to be
stated instead: preserve behavior during extraction, with separately
identified bug-fix chunks allowed to change it.

### The finding is correct

Verified against the commits rather than taken on trust:

- `7e6ff95` (Chunk 16b) changed six of the eight `PostfitExtractor`
  accessors - `GetNbins`, `GetNpars`, `GetNdof`, `GetH1Chi2`,
  `GetH1Postfit`, `GetH1Residuals` - from `next(iter(dict))` to
  `next(iter(dict.values()))`, so a no-argument call returns the value
  rather than the channel-name key.
- `d54e89a` (Chunk 16a) changed `WriteRoot(dirPerCategory=False)`'s
  three `.values()[-1]` expressions to `list(...values())[-1]`, turning
  a Python-3 `TypeError` into a working branch.

Both are public-facing, both were deliberate, and
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` did not mention Chunks 16a or 16b anywhere - so
the document claimed total preservation while omitting the two changes
that broke it.

### What changed

- The opening sentence now scopes the preservation claim to the
  extraction chunks and points at the two bug-fix chunks.
- The Purpose statement now states the real policy: an extraction chunk
  never changes what the code computes and preserves existing quirks
  verbatim; behavior may change only in a separate chunk identified as
  a bug fix that does no extraction of its own. It also names the
  invariant that *does* hold absolutely - guardrail 1's "no scientific
  change", proved by the Tier 1 gates - so the qualified claim is not
  read as a licence to change anything.
- A new "Deliberate behavior changes" section records both fixes: what
  each changed, why neither altered a production call path
  (`run_fit.py` always passes `channelname`, and always passes
  `dirPerCategory=True`), and that Chunk 16's characterization tests
  pinned both behaviors before either was fixed.
- The `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` module-map row now points at that
  section, since the accessor list is where a reader looks up what
  those methods do.

### Generalised to the class

Every document was swept for the same absolute wording
(`preserved exactly`, `never chang`, `no behavior change`,
`behavior-preserving`, `purely structural`, `identical behavior`,
`unchanged behavior`, and others). `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` lines 6 and 14
were the only *global* claims. Every other hit is correctly scoped to
one named quirk - `getChi2`'s external mutation, `run_templates.py`'s
`nPars` chain, `FindBHWindow.py`'s hardcoded scan parameters,
`plot_postfit()`'s public signature - and each remains true.
`doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`'s own guardrail 1 is "no scientific
change", not "no behavior change", so the plan never made the claim the
system document did; the two now agree.

### Verification performed

- `tests/test_repo_utils.py -k documented`: 3 passed - the
  figure-consistency tests still hold, the new section having added no
  figure claim of its own.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 230 collected, 210
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0.
- CI for `4aded75`: fork "Complete lightweight and scientific test
  suite" **success**; upstream PR 19 lightweight gate **success**.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Noted, not changed

- The Known-limitations entry for `_build_bkgonly_variant`'s
  misdirected `Scale` call describes it as a "dormant" bug. That may be
  inaccurate: the call executes on every run, and whether it is inert
  depends on whether `hpdf.Scale(...)` raises on an already-consumed
  histogram and is swallowed by the bare `except`. Determining which
  needs a real-ROOT probe and a judgement about intended scaling, so it
  is recorded here as an open question rather than silently reworded.
  The new section deliberately avoids repeating the word.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-08 — Make the gate-coverage checks reject negated selectors, and correct a reachability claim (ninth Copilot review round)

### Objective

Copilot's ninth review raised one inline finding on
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` and three suppressed findings on
`tests/test_repo_utils.py`, all variants of one question: does a check
that *names* something prove that the thing runs?

### The reachability claim was wrong

The "Deliberate behavior changes" section written in the previous entry
said `WriteRoot(dirPerCategory=False)` "was unreachable in production".
That is false, and it was this session's own wording:

- `python/run_nloFit.py:123` calls `WriteRoot(postfitfile)` with no
  flag, taking the default `False` (Copilot's finding).
- This module's own CLI also defaults to `False` -
  `--dirpercategory` is `store_true` and is passed through at
  `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py:628` (found by checking every
  `WriteRoot` call site rather than only the one cited).
- `python/pfe.py:42` passes `True`, so it is unaffected.
- `python/run_fit.py:166` still carries the no-flag call commented out
  with the note "this looks problematic" - consistent with it having
  crashed for someone.

The bullet now scopes the claim to the canonical `run_fit.py` path,
states plainly that the branch is not unreachable repository-wide, and
names both callers the fix repairs.

The neighbouring Chunk 16b bullet was checked for the same defect and
its claim held, but its wording was narrower than the evidence: no
non-test caller anywhere in the repository calls any of the six changed
accessors, and `run_nloFit.py:122`'s no-argument `GetPval()` is one of
the two that were always correct. Restated repo-wide.

### Two of the three selector findings were real

Each was sabotaged against the real files before anything changed:

- **Real.** Negating the runtime-readiness selector to
  `-k "not authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime"` left both
  gate-coverage tests passing. The fingerprint was a bare substring,
  which `not <name>` contains.
- **Real.** Negating the plotting gate's filter to
  `-m "not requires_analysis_dependencies"` also left them passing: every
  filename was still present while none of the marked tests would run.
- **False positive.** Negating the scientific marker to
  `-m "not (integration and requires_root)"` did *not* pass - the
  fingerprint is quote-delimited (`'"integration and requires_root"'`),
  and the negated form puts `(` and `)` where the quotes must be, so it
  never matched. Verified by sabotage rather than by reading, since the
  distinction turns on two characters.

### What changed

- `_pytest_option_value(line, option)` reads a `-k`/`-m` value from one
  command line. It parses only the text after the `pytest` token,
  because `python -m pytest` carries an `-m` of its own; an earlier
  version of this helper read that and compared every marker filter
  against the string "pytest", which made both coverage tests fail
  against the real, correct files.
- `_selects_positively(value, expression)` requires the expression to
  be present *and* the value to contain no `not`.
  `_marker_filter_keeps()` is the same rule but treats a missing `-m`
  as acceptable, since no filter deselects nothing.
- `_INTEGRATION_TEST_SELECTORS` now carries the option each test is
  selected by, not a bare substring, and both coverage loops work per
  command line: a file counts as covered only when some pytest line
  both names it and carries a filter that keeps the marker.
- Any `not` disqualifies a value. That is deliberately conservative -
  neither source uses a mixed expression such as
  `-m "requires_analysis_dependencies and not slow"`, and the helper
  says that if one ever legitimately does, it must be taught to parse
  the expression rather than accept the negation.

### Verification performed

- Five sabotages, each restored afterwards, all confirmed passing
  before and failing after: the `-k` and `-m` negations in
  `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`, the same two in
  `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`, and the parenthesised
  marker negation.
- `test_pytest_selectors_are_read_positively_and_reject_negation` pins
  all of them, including the `python -m pytest` collision.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 231 collected, 211
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0.
- The live-collection test caught the documented figures going stale
  when the new test was added, exactly as intended - it failed with
  "the documented lightweight gate figure '230 collected' does not
  match a real collection, which reports 231". Documented lightweight
  (231/211/20) and prepared-dependency (27/2/25) figures updated
  accordingly.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-08 — Apply the positive-selection rule to every remaining policy check of the same shape

### Objective

Round 9 established a rule for this repository's policy tests: parse the
structure, require positive selection, and never treat the presence of
a name as proof that the thing runs. This pass audited every remaining
content-membership assertion in `tests/test_repo_utils.py` against that
rule, rather than waiting for a review round to find the next instance.

### What the audit found

Four real defects, each confirmed by sabotage before anything changed,
in checks no review round had reached:

- **The pre-commit hook's scientific gate could be deselected.**
  Appending `-k "not test_authoritative_j100_j50_workflows_match_frozen_reference"`
  beside the correct `-m "integration and requires_root"` left
  `test_git_hook_pre_commit_gate_matches_authoritative_commands`
  passing. This is round 9's exact defect, in the test guarding the
  repository's *mandatory local* gate.
- **The same hook's gates could be disabled by an always-false guard.**
  `if false && ! "$python_bin" scripts/quality_check.py --mode full;`
  keeps every command's text in the executable lines, so the check
  still found what it was looking for.
- **`install.sh`'s `--check` mode was proved by its own help text.**
  Renaming the dispatch arm to `--no-check)` left
  `test_install_script_is_non_destructive` passing, because `--check`
  still appears in the usage heredoc. The installer would no longer
  accept the flag the test says it supports.
- **Both "non-destructive" installer tests missed recursive deletes.**
  `"rm -rf" not in active_script` is satisfied by `rm -fr`, `rm -r -f`
  and `rm --recursive --force`, all three confirmed to pass. These are
  the two tests whose names promise the installers destroy nothing.

### What changed

- `_keeps_test_selected(line, marker, test_name)`: both filters must
  cooperate - the `-m` filter has to keep the marker, and any `-k` has
  to name the test rather than exclude or narrow past it.
- `_assert_no_always_false_guard()`: rejects `if/while/until false` and
  `! true` outright. A general reachability analysis of shell is out of
  scope and the helper says so; this catches the quickest way to
  disable a gate while leaving its text in place.
- `_RECURSIVE_DELETE`: matches `rm` with any recursive flag, however
  spelled or ordered. Neither installer runs `rm` at all, so it cannot
  misfire; a non-recursive `rm -f` of one file still passes
  deliberately.
- `install.sh`'s two modes are now asserted against the `case`
  dispatch, not the whole script: `--check)`/`run_check` alongside the
  `--build)`/`run_build` pair that was already checked there.
- One near-vacuous assertion tightened: `"expected" in active_script`
  matched a bare word, and is now the full `"; expected "` phrase.

### A correction to this session's own record

The always-false-guard finding was first reported as confirmed on the
strength of a sabotage that was in fact a **no-op**: it replaced the
string `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`, which does not
occur in `.githooks/pre-commit` - the hook reads
`"$python_bin" scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`. Both the before
and after readings were therefore meaningless. The finding is real, but
only as established afterwards by a sabotage that does apply
(`if false && ! ...`), proved in both directions: the new guard fails
it, and removing the guard lets it pass.

### Verification performed

- Six sabotages, each restored afterwards, all confirmed passing before
  and failing after: the hook's `-k` negation; the hook's always-false
  guard; `install.sh`'s renamed dispatch arm; and `rm -fr`,
  `rm -r -f`, `rm --recursive --force` across both installers.
- `test_a_named_command_is_not_a_command_that_runs` pins all of them,
  including the benign cases the new rules must not reject.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 233 collected, 213
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented lightweight (233/213/20) and prepared-dependency
  (29/2/27) figures updated, the live-collection test having caught
  them going stale again.
- `install.sh --check`: exit code 0, all seven gitlink and nested
  RooFitExtensions revisions PASS, no files modified.
- The prepared-dependency gate run for real at both this tree state and
  `2c9a8b5`'s: 2 passed, exit 0 in each.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### The CI failure on `2c9a8b5` was caused by that commit

CI for `2c9a8b5` concluded **failure** at step 13, "Verify dependencies
after build", and the three ROOT gates after it were skipped. The cause
was that commit's own diff, contrary to the reasoning recorded while
the job log was unavailable:

```
tests/test_repo_utils.py:535: in <module>
    def _pytest_option_value(line: str, option: str) -> str | None:
E   TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'type' and 'NoneType'
```

Step 13's third part runs the prepared-dependency gate *after* sourcing
`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`, so it runs under the LCG runtime's
**Python 3.9.12**, not the development venv's 3.12. A `str | None` in a
function signature is evaluated when the `def` executes, so it raises
there and collection dies before any test runs.

The earlier inference - that the diff could not be responsible because
it touched only tests and documentation - was wrong in its premise: the
one file it touched is a file the scientific gates load under 3.9. It
was also checked with the wrong interpreter. The prepared-dependency
gate was run locally and reported 2 passed, but by way of
`.venv/bin/python`; `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` runs that gate the same
way, with `$python_bin`, which is why no local gate could reproduce it.
The divergence between the two runners is recorded below.

Reproduced here under the real interpreter, fixed by adding
`from __future__ import annotations`, and confirmed: 2 passed under
Python 3.9.12.

### Guarded against recurrence

Nine of the ten test files the scientific gates run already carried
`from __future__ import annotations`; `tests/test_repo_utils.py` was the
sole exception and had no union signatures until this work added three.
The convention existed and was broken silently, so it is now checked:

- `test_files_loaded_by_the_scientific_gates_are_importable_on_python_39`
  parses every dependency-marked test file and every registered source
  module, and fails when one evaluates an `X | Y` annotation at import
  time without deferring annotations. The file set comes from the
  markers and from `quality_check.py`'s own target lists, so it grows
  by itself.
- Deliberately narrow, and the test says so: it catches this one
  incompatibility, not 3.9 compatibility in general. Syntax 3.9 cannot
  parse at all - a `match` statement - is accepted by the 3.12 parser
  the check runs under and would not be caught.
- Sabotage-verified both ways: removing the future import fails the
  **lightweight** gate, where the break is visible in seconds instead
  of two steps into the hosted workflow, and the same sabotage was
  confirmed to reproduce the real collection error under Python 3.9.12.
  Adding a union signature to `python/repo_utils.py` is caught too.

### Noted, not changed

- The prepared-dependency gate runs under a **different interpreter** in
  the two places that run it: `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` uses
  `$python_bin` (the 3.12 development venv), while
  `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` step 13 runs it after
  sourcing the scientific setup, under Python 3.9.12. Both are
  defensible - the tests only inspect submodule directories with Git -
  but it means the local all-gates runner cannot reproduce a 3.9-only
  failure in that gate, which is precisely what happened here. Making
  them agree is a change to the gate contract and was not made
  unilaterally.

### Remaining open chunks

None.

## 2026-09-08 — Close two holes in the checks added yesterday: the 3.9 guard missed five annotation slots, and command parsing kept trailing comments (tenth Copilot review round)

### Objective

Copilot's tenth review found that two of the parsers added in the
previous two commits could still report coverage, or Python 3.9
compatibility, when neither held. Both findings were about checks this
session had just written to prevent exactly that.

### Finding 1 (High): the 3.9 guard inspected one slot in six

`_evaluated_pep604_unions()` walked only regular and keyword-only
arguments plus the return annotation. Every case below was then run
under the real LCG **Python 3.9.12** before anything was changed, and
all six raise `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |`:

| slot | detected before | raises on 3.9 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| positional-only argument | no | yes |
| `*args` | no | yes |
| `**kwargs` | no | yes |
| module-level annotated assignment | no | yes |
| class-level annotated assignment | no | yes |
| regular argument / return | yes | yes |
| function-local annotated assignment | no | **no** |

So the guard written to stop the previous CI break would have missed
five of the six ways to cause it. The last row is why it must not
simply flag every union: a local annotation is never evaluated, which
is exactly what makes this file's own `quote: str | None = None` locals
safe, and had always been safe.

The traversal now covers `posonlyargs`, `args`, `kwonlyargs`,
`vararg`, `kwarg` and `returns`, plus `AnnAssign` at module and class
scope, while excluding annotations inside a function body. Nested
`def`s and classes declared inside a function are reported too: their
annotations are evaluated when the enclosing scope runs rather than at
import, so the break is later rather than absent.

### Finding 2: a trailing comment counted as part of the command

`_pytest_command_lines()` dropped whole-line comments but kept trailing
ones, so a live command could carry the expected selector in inert
text:

```
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "not requires_analysis_dependencies" -v \
  # -k authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime
```

The `-k` parsed out of that comment satisfied the runtime-readiness
coverage check while the real filter selected nothing. Confirmed
against `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` itself. The same gap existed in
`_executable_command_lines()`, and through it in every check built on
that extractor - the pre-commit hook's, the installers', and the CI
workflow's, since `_workflow_run_block_lines()` feeds into it.

Both extractors now apply the file's existing `_strip_inline_comment()`,
which respects quoting: `grep "#define FOO"` and `--opt="a#b"` survive,
while `real_command  # disabled` loses only the comment.

### Finding 3: the first fix for Finding 2 stripped comments too late

The eleventh review round restated Finding 2 against the pre-fix code,
but its suggested changeset differed from the fix in one way that
turned out to matter: it removes comments **before** joining
backslash-continued lines, where the first fix removed them after.

Six adversarial inputs were compared under both orderings, including a
`#` that only becomes quoted once lines are joined; all six agreed. One
case did not:

```
setup_thing  # see docs \
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

A `\` inside a comment is not a line continuation, but stripping after
the join treats it as one, so the comment swallowed the following line
and the real gate command vanished - `_executable_command_lines()`
returned only `setup_thing`, and `_pytest_command_lines()` returned
nothing at all. That is the opposite failure to Finding 2's: a false
*failure* rather than a false pass, and a genuine mis-parse of a
legitimate script either way.

The reviewer's ordering was adopted, via a shared `_uncommented_lines()`
helper both extractors now use, and the whole earlier sabotage battery
was re-run against it to confirm nothing was weakened.

### Verification performed

- Six sabotages, each restored afterwards, all confirmed passing before
  and failing after: the four previously-missed annotation slots
  injected one at a time into `python/repo_utils.py`, a real
  trailing-comment rewrite of `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`'s
  runtime-readiness gate, and - as a false-positive guard that must
  keep passing - a function-local union in the same module.
- Every slot's behaviour was established by executing it under Python
  3.9.12, not by reading the language reference.
- Two regression tests pin all of it, including the three safe cases
  the check must not report (`typing.Optional`, function-local
  annotations, no annotations at all), and both directions of the
  comment-ordering defect.
- The full earlier sabotage battery re-run after the reordering, each
  restored afterwards, all six still caught: the trailing-comment
  attack, an echo-quoted gate command, the hook's `-k` negation, the CI
  workflow's `-m` negation, a commented-out CI gate, and `rm -fr` in
  `install.sh`. The ordering itself was then reverted in place to
  confirm its regression test fails without it.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 235 collected, 215
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0.
- `tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies"` under
  Python 3.9.12: 2 passed. Documented lightweight (235/215/20) and
  prepared-dependency (31/2/29) figures updated.
- CI for `5f2d366`: **success**, with steps 13-16 all passing - the
  three ROOT gates that were skipped on `2c9a8b5` ran and passed, which
  confirms the previous entry's diagnosis end to end rather than
  leaving it inferred.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-08 — Parse decorators instead of scanning for them (twelfth Copilot review round)

### Objective

Copilot's twelfth review found that `_dependency_marked_test_names()`
drops a marked test when another decorator sits between the marker and
the `def`, and never recognises `async def`. Both are real, and a third
shape was found by testing the helper against every decorator layout
rather than only the two named.

### What was broken

The helper scanned lines: find the marker, skip further
`@pytest.mark.` lines, record the following `def`. Six shapes were
tried against a synthetic file:

| shape | found |
| --- | --- |
| bare marker | yes |
| marker with `()` | yes |
| stacked `@pytest.mark.*` | yes |
| any other decorator between marker and `def` (`@mock.patch(...)`) | **no** |
| `async def` | **no** |
| multi-line `@pytest.mark.parametrize(...)` below the marker | **no** |

The third miss is the one no review round named, and the likeliest to
occur here: this suite parametrizes widely, and a multi-line
`parametrize` placed below the dependency marker leaves continuation
lines that are neither a decorator nor a `def`, so the scan gives up.

The consequence is the one the review describes.
`_assert_covers_every_dependency_marked_test()` asserts that the
integration file's marked tests equal the selector map's keys, so a
dropped test keeps that equality true, nothing forces a gate selector
for it, and it would never run in any gate while every check stayed
green.

### What changed

`_dependency_marked_test_names()` now parses the file and reads each
function's `decorator_list`, via a new `_pytest_marker_names()` helper.
Decorator order, interleaving, arguments, line breaks and `async` all
stop mattering. `@pytest.mark.x` and `@mark.x` are both recognised.

The sibling `_tests_dir_files_marked_requires_analysis_dependencies()`
was **left as it is**, deliberately. It matches the marker name
anywhere in the file, and its own comment already explains why: a file
merely mentioning the marker is still required to appear in the gate
lists, and erring that way causes a false failure, never a false pass.
Converting it to the parser would make it exact but less conservative,
so the inconsistency between the two helpers is intentional.

### Verification performed

- The parser returns **identical** results to the line scanner on all
  21 real test files, so this widens detection without changing any
  current behaviour.
- Three sabotages, each restored afterwards: a marked test added to
  `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py` in each of the three
  previously-dropped shapes. All three now fail both gate-coverage
  tests.
- The `@mock.patch` sabotage was also run against the committed line
  scanner to confirm the fix is what catches it: with the old helper
  both coverage tests **passed**, a silent all-clear for a test no gate
  would run.
- `test_marked_tests_are_found_whatever_decorators_surround_them` pins
  all seven detected shapes and three that must not be reported,
  including the marker named only inside a string. Verified
  non-vacuous by restoring the line scanner underneath it, which fails
  it on `other_decorator_between`.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 236 collected, 216
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented lightweight (236/216/20) and prepared-dependency
  (32/2/30) figures updated.
- `tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies"` under
  Python 3.9.12: 2 passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-08 — Validate both pytest filters per mapped test, and remove the duplicate rule that let one drift (thirteenth Copilot review round)

### Objective

Copilot's thirteenth review found that the integration coverage check
proves only that the expected selector is *present*, not that the
invocation still selects the test once every filter is combined.

### Why one filter is not enough

`-m` and `-k` are independent pytest filters combined with AND: a test
runs only if it satisfies both. The check validated one option per
mapped test - `-k` for the runtime-readiness test, `-m` for the
scientific one - so adding the *other* filter deselects the test while
the validated one remains exactly right:

```
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -k authoritative_setup_provides_scientific_runtime \
  -m "not requires_analysis_dependencies" -v

python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" \
  -k "not authoritative_j100_j50_workflows_match_frozen_reference" -v
```

Both passed, in `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` and in
`.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` - four holes. The effect is
that the repository's headline scientific gate could be emptied while
every policy test reported full coverage.

### The cause was a duplicate rule, not a missing idea

`_keeps_test_selected()` already existed in this file, already
implemented exactly this both-halves rule, and already rejected the
second attack. It was added three rounds earlier and wired into
`.githooks/pre-commit`'s own check, while the gate-coverage loop kept
the weaker single-option version. The later sweep "of every remaining
check of that shape" audited the other tests and never re-audited the
one it had just rewritten.

So this is a different failure from the four rounds before it. Those
were text scanning where parsing was needed - the wrong tool. Here the
right tool was present, working, and applied to one of the two places
that needed it.

### What changed

- `_invocation_runs_test(line, designated, guard)` is now the single
  predicate: `designated` must positively select, and `guard` - the
  other option - must not deselect, with absent counting as fine.
- `_keeps_test_selected()` is now a thin marker-designated case of it
  rather than a parallel implementation. The duplication was the actual
  defect; the missing check was the symptom.
- `_INTEGRATION_TEST_SELECTORS` carries both halves per test: the
  readiness test's `-k` name with `-m requires_analysis_dependencies`
  as its guard, and the scientific test's `-m` marker with its own name
  as the guard.

### Verification performed

- Four sabotages, each restored afterwards, all confirmed passing
  before and failing after: the guard filter added to the readiness and
  scientific lines, in both the gate runner and the CI workflow.
- `test_a_second_filter_cannot_quietly_deselect_a_mapped_test` pins
  them, plus the cases that must keep passing - the real invocations, a
  guard filter that *keeps* the test, and no guard at all - and that a
  wrong designated selector still fails. Verified non-vacuous by making
  the guard half return `True` unconditionally, which fails it.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 237 collected, 217
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented lightweight (237/217/20) and prepared-dependency
  (33/2/31) figures updated.
- `tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies"` under
  Python 3.9.12: 2 passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-08 — Read `rm`'s words instead of its shape, so an ordinary filename is no longer a recursive delete (fourteenth Copilot review round)

### Objective

One finding, Medium: `_RECURSIVE_DELETE`'s `-{0,2}` also accepts *no*
dash, so the pattern read the operand as a flag. `rm report.txt` was
reported as a recursive delete.

### Independently verified, and it is worse than the one example

Run against the pattern directly, four benign commands matched, not
one: `rm report.txt`, `rm results.json`, `rm -f error.log` and
`rm -- report.txt`. Any operand containing an `r` did it.

The direction matters. Every previous finding in this class was a false
*pass* - a check reporting coverage that did not exist. This one is a
false *failure*: the two installer policy tests would have rejected an
ordinary single-file cleanup as a recursive delete. So this detector is
made precise, rather than left deliberately over-inclusive the way
`_tests_dir_files_marked_requires_analysis_dependencies` is.

It was dormant: neither installer runs `rm` at all, which is why no
test caught it and why nothing in the repository was blocked by it.

Measuring also turned up a second hole in the same pattern, in the
opposite direction: `rm build -rf` - options after the operand, which
`rm` itself accepts - matched neither the old pattern nor the fix
Copilot suggested.

### What changed

- `_recursive_delete(text)` replaces the positional regex. It finds
  each `rm`, takes the words up to the next shell separator, and tests
  each word on its own with `fullmatch`. An operand is never a flag,
  because a flag has to be a whole word starting with a dash.
- Options after the operand are now caught, since word order stops
  mattering.
- `--no-preserve-root` is deliberately not recursive, despite the `r`,
  and a later command's flags are not attributed to `rm`.

### Verification performed

- Both directions proved end to end on both installers, restored
  afterwards. Against the old code: appending a benign `rm report.txt`
  failed both installer tests (the reported defect, reproduced), while
  `rm build -rf` passed both (the second hole). Against the fix: the
  benign lines pass, `rm build -rf` and `rm -rf build` both fail with
  the offending command quoted.
- The regression cases in
  `test_a_named_command_is_not_a_command_that_runs` were verified
  non-vacuous by three separate sabotages of the detector, each failing
  it: returning `None` always, allowing zero dashes again, and dropping
  the argument-list boundary. The first attempt at the benign cases did
  *not* catch the zero-dash sabotage - word-wise `fullmatch` rejects
  `report.txt` for its dot regardless - so `rm report`, an
  extensionless operand, was added as the case that actually pins the
  dash requirement.
- Swept every other compiled pattern in the file for the same shape.
  This was the only one that parses command options; the rest match
  commands, comments, decorators or reported figures, none of which
  read an operand as a flag.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 237 collected, 217
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. No test was added or removed, so the documented figures are
  unchanged.
- `tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies"` under
  Python 3.9.12: 2 passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-09 — Evaluate pytest's filter expressions instead of pattern-matching them, and check every marked test rather than every file (fifteenth Copilot review round)

### Objective

Three suppressed findings, all in the gate-coverage checks, all real:

1. the always-false-guard check was applied to `.githooks/pre-commit`
   only, never to the two gate sources these checks read;
2. the file-level check validated only the `-m` filter, so a `-k` could
   drop most of a file's marked tests while the file was still named;
3. `_selects_positively()` accepted an unsatisfiable expression -
   `<name> and nonexistent` contains the name and carries no `not`.

### Independently verified, all three, before changing anything

Finding 3 against real pytest: `-k "authoritative_setup_provides_
scientific_runtime and nonexistent"` collected **0 of 3** tests, and
`-m "integration and requires_root and nonexistent_marker"` collected
0 of 3, while the predicate returned True for both.

Finding 1 by sabotage: the whole scientific gate wrapped in a multiline
`if false; then ... fi` - valid shell, confirmed with `bash -n` - left
both gate-coverage tests passing.

Finding 2 by measurement, and it was the worst of the three: adding one
`-k <test name>` to the plotting gate took it from **48 dependency-
marked tests to 1**, with every filename still present and the marker
filter still keeping the marker. Both tests passed.

### The root cause was approximating a language instead of evaluating it

`-k` and `-m` are boolean expressions, and pytest combines them with
AND. Three successive rounds each replaced one approximation with a
slightly better one:

- substring membership - broken by `not <expression>`;
- substring plus "reject any `not`" - broken by
  `<expression> and nonexistent`;
- and each fix was written to defeat the specific example given.

So the expressions are now parsed and evaluated against the mapped
test's real name and markers. Negation, extra conjunctions, `or`,
parentheses and mixed expressions are all handled by construction
rather than by rule. A side effect worth naming: the previous rule
rejected a legitimate `-m "requires_analysis_dependencies and not
slow"`, which was documented as deliberately conservative. Evaluating
gets that right too.

### What changed

- `_expression_selects(expression, is_true)` evaluates one `-k`/`-m`
  expression over `and`/`or`/`not`/parentheses. Anything unparseable,
  or any other construct, returns False - unproven counts as not
  selected, so the check fails loudly rather than accepting what it did
  not understand.
- `_filters_keep_test()` always judges both options.
  `_invocation_runs_test()` adds the one policy requirement on top: the
  designated option must be present, so a gate selects its test
  deliberately rather than merely failing to exclude it.
- `_selects_positively()`, `_marker_filter_keeps()` and
  `_keeps_test_selected()` are gone. They were three spellings of the
  same approximation, and the duplication is what let one of them drift
  a round behind the others.
- `_dependency_marked_tests()` reads each marked test's real markers
  from the AST, so `_INTEGRATION_TEST_SELECTORS`' restated expressions
  are gone too - the map now records only which option selects which
  test.
- The file-level loop became a per-test loop: every dependency-marked
  test is checked against the invocations that name its file. Files are
  still enumerated by the over-inclusive text scan, and a flagged file
  with no AST-visible marked test still gets the file-level check, so
  that net is not lost.
- `_assert_no_always_false_guard()` now runs on both gate sources.

### Verification performed

- Four end-to-end sabotages of the real gate sources, each restored:
  the `if false` wrapper, the narrowing `-k`, and the unsatisfiable
  extra term in both `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` and
  `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`. All four previously
  passed; all four now fail, each on the correct source.
- Each of the three fixes was individually reverted to its exact
  previous rule and confirmed to fail a committed test:
  `test_gate_coverage_rejects_a_disabled_or_narrowed_gate` for the
  first two, `test_pytest_filters_are_evaluated_against_the_real_test`
  and `test_a_second_filter_cannot_quietly_deselect_a_mapped_test` for
  the third. The first attempt at the second revert was not faithful -
  it went through the new code path and still raised - so it was redone
  as the actual `-m`-only rule.
- The new tests were also run under the LCG Python 3.9.12, not just
  collected there: 6 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 238 collected, 218
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented lightweight (238/218/20) and prepared-dependency
  (34/2/32) figures updated.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-09 — Close every remaining way to empty a gate without changing its command: --deselect, --collect-only, a workflow condition, an environment override, an addopts override, and the installer text views

### Objective

The previous round fixed the two pytest expression filters on the
stated premise that `-k` and `-m` are what decide whether a test runs.
Asked to sweep all 34 policy tests for anything of the same class, that
premise turned out to be incomplete. Six more vectors were found, each
confirmed by sabotage and measurement, each leaving every pytest
command on the page untouched.

### Correction to the previous entry

That entry called all three of its findings cases where the gate ran
nothing. Measured afterwards: an unsatisfiable extra term makes pytest
collect nothing and exit **5**, and both `run_gate` and the CI step
check the exit status, so that one would have failed loudly the first
time it ran. It was a false pass in the *check*, not a silent hole in
the gate. The other two exit 0 and were silent.

### What was found, and how it was measured

1. **`--deselect`** - a third filter, independent of both expressions,
   whose whole purpose is to remove a named test. One `--deselect` took
   the plotting gate from 18 dependency-marked tests to 17; pointed at
   a file, to 16. Exit 0. Both coverage tests passed.
2. **`--collect-only`** (and `--co`) - collects everything, runs none
   of it, exits 0. The only veto that leaves no trace in the gate's own
   result.
3. **A workflow condition** - `if: false` on the scientific gate step
   skipped it entirely and left all three CI policy tests passing. This
   is the YAML twin of the shell `if false; then ... fi` that the
   previous round *did* fix; the fix only ever covered shell, and the
   CI text is reduced to `run:` block contents before the guard check
   sees it, so `if:` is invisible there by construction.
4. **`PYTEST_ADDOPTS`** - pytest applies it to every invocation, so one
   line in a gate source filters every gate in it. A 5-test file went
   to 0 selected.
5. **pytest's `addopts` config** - applies repository-wide.
   `-k nothing_matches_this` empties a gate *even though the gate
   passes its own `-m`*, because the two options are independent and
   both apply. An `addopts` `-m` is overridden by a command-line `-m`,
   so that spelling alone cannot empty these gates.
6. **The two installer tests** - about sixty "the script does X"
   assertions against text with only whole-line comments removed: no
   trailing-comment handling, no echo filtering, no guard check. That
   is the state the gate checks were in five rounds ago. Three valid-
   shell sabotages passed: both real `cmake --build` calls replaced by
   `true # cmake --build --parallel`, the same replaced by
   `echo "cmake --build --parallel"`, and `run_build()`'s entire body
   wrapped in `if false`.

Two candidates were tested and rejected rather than fixed:
`--ignore=<file>` has no effect when the file is named explicitly on
the command line, which it always is in these gates (18 tests before,
18 after); and an `addopts` `-m`, as above.

### What changed

- `_filters_keep_test()` now judges every mechanism that can drop a
  test, not the two it happened to know first: both expressions,
  `--deselect`, and `--collect-only`. It also refuses a short option
  glued to its value (`-knothing`), which it cannot parse - unparseable
  counts as unproven, because "absent" means "filters nothing" and
  would be the wrong answer.
- `_pytest_option_values()` reads *every* occurrence of an option and
  both the `--option value` and `--option=value` spellings.
  `--deselect` is repeatable, and reading only the first was enough
  only while nothing repeated.
- `_deselects_test()` matches loosely on the path - any path ending in
  the test's own file, or the tests directory - so an unfamiliar
  spelling causes a false failure rather than a false pass.
- `test_no_gate_source_can_be_disabled_or_globally_filtered()` rejects
  any workflow condition, `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` in any gate source, and any
  selection-affecting `addopts`. Conditions are rejected outright
  rather than evaluated: a computed condition cannot be decided here,
  and evaluating GitHub's expression language is as out of scope as
  shell reachability analysis. No workflow uses `if:` at all, so this
  costs nothing today and fails loudly if one is added.
- `selection_affecting_addopts()` lives in `python/repo_utils.py`, and
  `scripts/quality_check.py` applies it **before** starting pytest.
  This is the one case a test cannot cover: `addopts =
  "--collect-only"` makes the policy file itself collect and not run,
  so the assertion would never execute. The gate has to refuse first.
  One rule, two callers - duplicating it is what let the filter checks
  drift a round apart.
- `_installer_views()` gives both installer tests one hardened set of
  views (comments stripped whole-line and trailing; a commands view
  with echoes and heredocs dropped; an invocations view without
  function definitions) and rejects an always-false guard once for
  both. Seven claims that are about commands moved onto the commands
  view; claims about messages the installer prints stay on the text
  view, which is why echoes are not dropped there.

### Verification performed

- Every vector sabotaged against the real file and restored: six
  spellings of the pytest vetoes in `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`
  (`--collect-only`, `--co`, `--deselect` by node id, by file, with
  `=`, and `-knothing`), `if: false` and a `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` env block
  in the CI workflow, an exported `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` in the gate script,
  three `addopts` values in `pyproject.toml`, and three sabotages of
  `install.sh`. All passed before; all fail now.
- Each fix individually reverted to its previous behaviour and
  confirmed to fail a committed test - the deselect check, the
  collect-only check, the multi-value option reader, the YAML
  condition pattern, the `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` pattern, the addopts
  unquoting, and the installer views.
- Two vacuity traps found and closed while doing that. The workflow and
  addopts checks read the repository's own files, which are clean, so
  they passed with their detectors neutered; the installer wiring had
  the same problem. `test_the_disabling_detectors_actually_detect()`
  and `test_the_installer_views_reject_text_that_never_runs()` pin them
  on synthetic input instead. Both were confirmed to fail when the
  thing they pin is reverted.
- One of my own bugs, found by measuring rather than reading: the
  addopts check reported nothing on a real `addopts = "-k nothing"`,
  because the option boundary was blocked by the opening quote. The
  value is unquoted first now.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 242 collected, 222
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented lightweight (242/222/20) and prepared-dependency
  (38/2/36) figures updated.
- The new tests were run, not just collected, under the LCG Python
  3.9.12: 7 passed.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-09 — Reject a node id in place of a filename, the one half of Copilot's "node selectors" that the previous commit missed

### Objective

Re-reading the fifteenth review's own words against what was actually
implemented. Its second finding asked for `-k` "and node selectors" to
be validated. The previous commit implemented the `--deselect`
spelling and treated the finding as closed. It is not the only
spelling.

### The gap, measured

A pytest argument can name a single test instead of a file:

```
tests/test_pre_fit.py::test_fit_raises_indexerror_for_npars_above_seven_with_default_ranges
```

That took `tests/test_pre_fit.py` from two dependency-marked tests to
one. Both coverage tests passed. This one is invisible to the previous
checks by construction: they pick the lines to examine by looking for
the filename, and a node id *contains* the filename.

### What changed

- `_selects_whole_file()` requires a real positional reference to the
  test's file, and when every reference is a node id, the mapped test
  has to be one of the tests named. Class-qualified node ids count, and
  a bare filename alongside a node id still selects the whole file.
- `_pytest_positional_arguments()` skips the values of options that
  consume the following word, so the file named inside `--deselect
  tests/x.py` or `--ignore tests/x.py` is no longer read as the
  invocation *selecting* that file. A line that mentions the file only
  in an option value now correctly counts as not running it.

### Verification performed

- The node-id narrowing sabotaged into the real `run_all_gates.sh`:
  passed before, fails now.
- The whole earlier battery re-run against the real script to confirm
  nothing regressed - `--collect-only`, `--co`, `--deselect` by file
  and by node id (both spellings), `-knothing`, a narrowing `-k`, an
  unsatisfiable `-m` term, and a negated `-m`. Nine attacks, nine
  failures, baseline clean.
- Both new behaviours reverted individually and confirmed to fail a
  committed test. The first attempt at pinning the option-value
  skipping did not: the `--deselect` case it used is caught by the
  deselect check as well, so it passed with the skipping removed.
  `--ignore` isolates it, and that case is what pins it now.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 242 collected, 222
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. No test added or removed, so the documented figures are
  unchanged.
- Under the LCG Python 3.9.12: 2 passed for the extended tests, 2
  passed for the prepared-dependency gate.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-09 — Sweep for the same class one level further out: a file no gate runs at all

### Objective

Asked to look for further cases of the class, with the lens moved from
"a gate that selects nothing" to "a file no gate reaches". Two surfaces
had it; three candidates were examined and cleared.

### What was found, and measured

**A test file nothing runs.** `scripts/quality_check.py` lists its
targets by hand. A new `tests/test_zz_unregistered_probe.py` whose only
test was `assert False` left the lightweight gate green - 242
collected, 222 passed, all checks passed - and every policy test in
`tests/test_repo_utils.py` passing. It is not run, and it is not linted
or formatted either, since Ruff and Black take the same list. This is
the gate-coverage class one level out: those checks prove a registered
file's tests are selected; nothing proved the file reaches a gate.

**A Python module the 3.9 check never sees.** That check read the
dependency-marked test files - self-maintaining - plus the *registered*
`python_targets`. So a new module on the hot path escaped it until
someone remembered to register it, which is the same hand-maintained
weakness. Measured before widening: across all 51 `python/*.py` and
every `scripts/*.py`, there are zero PEP 604 offenders, so widening to
every source file costs nothing today.

### Examined and cleared, rather than "fixed"

- `assert_analysis_reference_close()` - the scientific gate's own
  comparison. It compares workflow-name sets both ways, fit-parameter
  name sets both ways, provenance exactly, `None` p-value *presence*
  symmetrically with `is not`, and the limit points exactly. There is
  no vacuous path through it. The empty `cls_limit_points` in the
  frozen reference is a real property of a run with limits disabled,
  not a comparison that skips.
- `test_repo_snapshot_matches_frozen_reference()` - an empty snapshot
  would raise `KeyError` on the three explicit `is True` assertions
  rather than compare equal.
- `scripts/compare_root_outputs.py` - would report no differences if
  handed no object paths, but no gate or script invokes it (only its
  own unit test), and `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md:245` already states it does
  not inventory every object. A manual tool, not a gate.
- No `conftest.py`, no `collect_ignore`, no `norecursedirs`, and no
  test file whose name pytest would skip.

### What changed

- `test_every_test_file_is_registered_with_a_gate()`: every
  `tests/test_*.py` must be registered, or named in
  `_TEST_FILES_RUN_BY_ANOTHER_GATE` - and an exemption has to point at
  a real gate invocation, read from `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` with the
  same positional-argument reader the coverage checks use, so the
  exemption list cannot become a place to park a file nothing runs.
  Stale registrations are rejected too.
- The 3.9 check now reads every `python/*.py` and `scripts/*.py`, not
  just the registered ones. The 18 legacy Python-2-era modules that a
  Python 3 AST cannot parse at all are named in
  `_UNPARSEABLE_LEGACY_MODULES` rather than skipped silently, so a
  *new* unparseable file fails the check instead of disappearing from
  it. The assertion is a subset test, so fixing a legacy file simply
  starts it being checked.

### Verification performed

- Registration check, four sabotages, all caught: a new unregistered
  test file; a registered target renamed out of existence; an exemption
  for a file no gate runs; and the gate script no longer naming the
  exempted file.
- Widened 3.9 check, four sabotages: an unregistered `python/` module
  and an unregistered `scripts/` module with a 3.9-fatal signature both
  caught, a new unparseable file caught, and - the negative control -
  the same module with `from __future__ import annotations` correctly
  passing.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 243 collected, 223
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented lightweight (243/223/20) and prepared-dependency
  (39/2/37) figures updated.
- Under the LCG Python 3.9.12: 2 passed for the prepared-dependency
  gate, and the two new/widened checks run there too. Parsing the
  legacy modules warns about invalid escape sequences - SyntaxWarning
  on 3.12, DeprecationWarning on 3.9.12 - so both are silenced inside
  the check rather than left to clutter the gate output.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

### Remaining open chunks

## 2026-09-09 — Parse pytest's addopts as TOML instead of reading one line of it (sixteenth Copilot review round)

### Objective

Four findings against 09f56ae, all in code added the same day, all
real: the `addopts` guard missed three forms pytest accepts, missed the
attached short-option spelling it already recognised elsewhere, and two
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` claims about `python/repo_utils.py` went stale in
the same PR that made them stale.

### The first finding is the most serious one of the whole PR

`addopts = ["--collect-only"]` - the TOML array form - made
`selection_affecting_addopts()` return nothing, so
`scripts/quality_check.py` ran pytest anyway. Measured on the real
gate:

```
collected 243 items / 20 deselected / 223 selected
=============== 223/243 tests collected (20 deselected) in 0.39s ===============
All checks passed!
exit code 0
```

Not one test executed, and the gate reported success. Every previous
false pass in this PR was a policy check reporting coverage that did
not exist; this one was the gate itself reporting a pass it had not
earned. The guard written specifically to prevent it had a hole because
it read one physical line and stripped the outer quote characters.

The multiline-string form and an array split across lines were missed
the same way. `addopts = "-knothing"` and `addopts = ["-k", "nothing"]`
were also missed; both deselect everything, though those exit 5, which
the runners already catch.

The second finding is pointed: `_GLUED_SHORT_OPTION` was added to
`tests/test_repo_utils.py` earlier the same day for exactly the
attached-value spelling, and the shared function did not know about it.
Two places reasoning about pytest options, one of them taught.

### What changed

- `pytest_addopts_words()` reads the setting with a real TOML parser -
  `tomllib` on 3.11+, `tomli` on the LCG runtime's 3.9.12 - and handles
  the string, array and multiline forms because the parser does. If
  neither parser exists it raises, because "no parser" must not read as
  "no offending options".
- `_selection_option()` recognises a value attached to a short option,
  and treats an unambiguous `--` prefix as the option it resolves to,
  since argparse does (`--co` and `--col` are `--collect-only`).
  `--color` is unaffected: no selecting option starts with it.
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s module inventory now says five functions, not
  four, and names `selection_affecting_addopts()` with why it is
  shared; the test-file map row records its coverage.

### Two of my own mistakes, both caught by the checks added yesterday

- The new `_selection_option(word: str) -> str | None` signature broke
  Python 3.9 compatibility. `test_files_loaded_by_the_scientific_gates_
  are_importable_on_python_39` - widened to every source file in the
  previous commit, specifically so an unregistered module could not
  escape it - failed on `python/repo_utils.py:135` immediately.
  `from __future__ import annotations` added. Without that widening
  this would have reached CI, as the same mistake did once before.
- Replacing a block of the test file by its start and end markers
  deleted `test_every_test_file_is_registered_with_a_gate()` along with
  it. `test_documented_gate_counts_match_a_real_collection` caught it
  within seconds: 242 collected against 243 documented. Restored from
  the committed version.

Neither would have been noticed by reading the diff.

### Verification performed

- Every form applied to the real `pyproject.toml` in turn, gate run
  each time: the array, the attached short option, the split array and
  the multiline string are now all refused with exit code 2 and the
  offending option named. Control run with a clean file passes.
- `python/repo_utils.py` exercised under the LCG Python 3.9.12, which
  takes the `tomli` branch: identical answers for the clean file, the
  array form and the attached short option.
- Both new behaviours reverted individually - the TOML parse back to
  the one-line reader, and the attached-value matching back to
  whole-word equality - each confirmed to fail
  `test_the_disabling_detectors_actually_detect`.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 243 collected, 223
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented figures already correct, so unchanged.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-09 — Audit of every Copilot finding as a class against the unreviewed fixes: four more instances, three of them in code added today

### Objective

Asked to evaluate all changes against Copilot's comments - not only
that each reported issue is fixed, but whether the same classes have
recurred in the fixes themselves. The last six commits have not been
reviewed, and they are where new instances would be. Each of the
recurring classes was turned into a hypothesis and measured.

### Found, measured, fixed

1. **A repeated filter takes the *last* value, and the reader took the
   first.** `-k` and `-m` use argparse's `store` action, so
   `-m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -m requires_root` applies the
   second. Measured on the plotting gate: 16 dependency-marked tests
   became 15, **exit code 0**, and both coverage tests passed. Silent.
   `--deselect` is an `append` action, where every occurrence counts,
   which is why `_deselects_test()` reads all of them - the two
   semantics now have one comment each explaining which applies.
2. **A short option bundled behind another flag.** pytest applies
   `-vk nothing` as `-v` plus `-k nothing`, and the readers saw no `-k`
   at all, which they reported as "no filter" - the opposite of the
   truth. Measured: `-vk <one test name>` took the plotting gate from
   16 marked tests to **1**, exit code 0, coverage tests passing.
   Worse than the `-knothing` form fixed this morning, which at least
   collected nothing and exited 5.
3. **A gate command inside a shell function nothing calls.** Wrapping
   the whole plotting gate in `never_called() { ... }` is valid shell
   (`bash -n` clean), runs nothing, leaves `failures` at zero so the
   script prints "All gates passed", and left both coverage tests
   passing. The installer checks had dropped function *definition*
   lines for this reason since two rounds ago; the gate-coverage
   checks never dropped the *body*.
4. **`-p no:python`** collects nothing at all. It exits 4, so a runner
   catches it, but the coverage checks reported the gate covered.

### Tested and rejected, rather than "fixed"

- `--lf --lfnf none` - no effect on these gates (16 tests before, 16
  after).
- The YAML `run:` block reader, against every block scalar form pytest
  workflows can use - `|`, `|-`, `|+`, `>`, `>-` and the inline form.
  All six extract correctly; there is no missed spelling here.
- `assert_analysis_reference_close()`, the repo-snapshot comparison and
  `scripts/compare_root_outputs.py` were cleared in the previous
  sweep and are unchanged since.

### What changed

- `_pytest_option_value()` returns the **last** occurrence, with the
  store-versus-append distinction stated where it matters.
- `_unreadable_short_option()` replaces `_GLUED_SHORT_OPTION`. Rather
  than enumerating the ways a bundle can hide a filter, only the forms
  this reader can actually interpret are accepted: a bare `-k`/`-m`
  with its value next, `-k=`/`-m=`, and bundles made entirely of
  selection-neutral letters (`vqsxl`). Everything else is unreadable,
  and unreadable counts as unproven. The real gate sources use only
  `-v`, `-k` and `-m` - confirmed by reading every pytest command in
  all four of them - so the whitelist costs nothing today and a new
  short option fails loudly until someone considers it.
- `_outside_function_bodies()` drops lines inside a shell function
  body, so a gate command has to sit at top level. `run_gate` is still
  fine: every pytest command is passed to it as an argument from top
  level, not written inside its body.

### A rule of mine that never fired, removed

`_DISABLED_PLUGIN` was written for `-p no:` and then deleted:
`_unreadable_short_option()` already rejects `-p`, because `p` is not
a neutral letter. Reverting the plugin rule failed no test, which is
how it was noticed. Two rules over the same ground is precisely what
let these checks drift apart in round 13, so the redundant one is gone
and the reason is recorded where the surviving one is defined.

### Two mistakes of my own this round

- A wrong assertion, not a wrong fix: `assert not keeps("-m requires_root")`
  failed because the test used in that case really does carry
  `requires_root`, so the last `-m` legitimately keeps it. Changed to
  `-m integration`, a real marker that test does not carry.
- Deleting the redundant rule by index range swallowed five unrelated
  helpers, and Ruff caught it immediately with three undefined names.
  Restored and redone with exact anchors. This is the second time a
  range-based edit has cut too much; anchors only from here.

### Verification performed

- Ten sabotages against the real `scripts/run_all_gates.sh`, each
  restored: `-m nothing`, a narrowing `-m`, `-vk nothing`, `-vk <real
  test>`, `-knothing`, `-p no:python`, `-p=no:python`,
  `--collect-only`, `--deselect <file>`, and - the negative control - a
  plain `-v`, which must still pass. Nine fail, the control passes.
- The uncalled-function sabotage on the real gate script: passed
  before, fails now, and the real sources still yield all five pytest
  command lines (four in the script, one in the hook).
- Each fix reverted individually and confirmed to fail a committed
  test: last-occurrence reading, the unreadable-short-option rule, and
  function-body dropping.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 244 collected, 224
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit
  code 0. Documented lightweight (244/224/20) and prepared-dependency
  (40/2/38) figures updated.
- Under the LCG Python 3.9.12: 2 passed for the prepared-dependency
  gate, 3 passed for the new and extended checks.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-09 — Second audit pass against Copilot's comments: the gate can read the wrong pytest config file, and three more shell forms hide a command

Re-pulled all thirteen Copilot reviews and twenty-six inline comments
from the GitHub API rather than working from the earlier verdicts. The
last review (11:51 UTC) reviewed `09f56ae`; `e562019` and `c51c881`
came after it, so this pass audited those two commits against the
comment classes instead of waiting for a review of them. All
forty-four earlier findings are still fixed. Three new instances were
found, all in code committed earlier today, plus one factually wrong
comment.

### 1. `_outside_function_bodies()` recognised one shell function form

Yesterday's commit `c51c881` added the rule that a gate command inside
a function nothing calls is not a command that runs. The rule matched
only `name() {`. Every other form bash accepts still hid the same
command in plain sight, each confirmed valid shell whose body never
runs, and each measured as counted-as-coverage before the fix:

- `function never_called {` - the keyword form without parentheses;
- `never-called() {` - a hyphenated name, which bash allows;
- `never_called() (` - a parenthesis body;
- `never_called() {` followed by `echo "}}"` - an unbalanced brace in
  a string, which drove the depth count negative and exposed every
  line after it as top-level text. `echo }}` unquoted did the same.

The fix is one wider rule, not four patches: the definition pattern
now covers the keyword form, any name that is not a shell
metacharacter, and both body delimiters, with the body opener allowed
on the following line; and `_body_depth_change()` counts delimiters
the way the shell does - quoted text removed first, braces counted
only as whole words - so a brace that is not a delimiter cannot end a
body early. `${HOME}`, `awk '{...}'`, `echo "}}"` and `echo }}` all
leave the depth alone.

Checked for over-reach: all three readers were run over all
twenty-five shell sources and workflow files at the old and new rule,
with zero differences, and the real gate sources still yield all five
pytest command lines.

### 2. The addopts guard was reading a file pytest might not read

`e562019` parses `pyproject.toml`'s `addopts` with a real TOML parser.
That is only worth anything if `pyproject.toml` is the file pytest
reads. Measured with pytest 9.1.1: a `pytest.ini` takes precedence and
pytest then prints "configfile: pytest.ini (WARNING: ignoring pytest
config in pyproject.toml!)" and ignores pyproject entirely -
testpaths, pythonpath and all three markers with it. `.pytest.ini`
behaves identically. `tox.ini` and `setup.cfg` are inert while
pyproject keeps its `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` table, and were
measured to be.

A bare `pytest.ini` is caught anyway, loudly: it takes `pythonpath`
with it, so collection fails with four errors at exit code 2. The
silent one copies this repository's testpaths, pythonpath and markers
across and adds `addopts = --collect-only`. Measured against the real
gate: pre-fix it printed "224/244 tests collected" and exit code 0,
having executed nothing, while the addopts check read a perfectly
clean `pyproject.toml`. Post-fix it is refused at exit code 2.

`effective_pytest_config_file(repo_root)` resolves pytest's real
precedence order and the gate refuses anything but `pyproject.toml`,
including no configuration file at all. One rule closes all five
candidate files at once, which is why no second INI `addopts` parser
was added - the redundant-rule mistake from the previous entry.

### 3. Nothing pinned that the gate calls its own refusal

Deleting `_ensure_pytest_config_runs_tests(repo_root)` from
`_run_fast_checks()` left the entire test file passing: every test
proved the rule worked, none proved the gate used it. This is the
vacuity class Copilot raised against the installer views, one file
further along. `test_the_lightweight_gate_applies_its_own_pytest_config_refusal`
reads `scripts/quality_check.py` with `ast` - a name in a comment or a
string cannot satisfy it - and checks both that the call exists and
that it comes before pytest starts, since a refusal applied after
pytest has reported a pass proves nothing. Both sabotages fail it.

### 4. A comment that was wrong

`_selection_option()` said "argparse accepts any unambiguous prefix,
so `--col` is `--collect-only`". Measured: pytest rejects `--col`,
`--desel` and `--ign` with "unrecognized arguments" and exit code 4.
The behaviour is kept - refusing an abbreviation costs nothing and
does not depend on that staying true - but it is now recorded as
deliberately stricter than pytest rather than as a fact about
argparse.

### Candidates tested and rejected

- Abbreviated long selection options in a gate command: pytest exits 4
  on every abbreviation measured, so they are loud, not silent. No
  reader change.
- `tox.ini` and `setup.cfg` `addopts`: inert while pyproject.toml
  carries the pytest table. Covered by the precedence rule above
  rather than by parsing them.
- Defined-but-never-called checks elsewhere: every function in
  `scripts/quality_check.py`, `python/repo_utils.py` and
  `scripts/compare_root_outputs.py` is either called in its own file
  or referenced by another, and all five gates in
  `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` are wrapped in `run_gate`.

### Verification performed

- Eight hidden shell forms, each run under `bash -n` and then executed
  to confirm it is valid shell whose body never runs, and each pinned
  as a test case; five visible controls that must still be read as
  real commands.
- The rule reverted with the new cases kept: they fail. Restored: they
  pass.
- The real repository sabotaged with a `pytest.ini` twice - bare, and
  copying pyproject's settings - each measured before and after the
  fix, and removed both times.
- The guard call deleted, and moved after pytest: both fail the new
  wiring test.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 246 collected, 226
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Documented lightweight (246/226/20) and prepared-dependency
  (42/2/40) figures updated.
- Under the LCG Python 3.9.12: 2 passed for the prepared-dependency
  gate, 3 passed for the new and extended checks, and
  `effective_pytest_config_file()` resolves correctly there (`tomli`
  and `configparser` both present).
- CI for `c51c881`: run 34351580191, attempt 1, success - all seven
  gate steps including the scientific and real-ROOT plotting gates.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$'` and `git diff --check`: clean.

## 2026-09-09 — A heredoc printed a gate command and the coverage checks read it as a command that runs

Found by re-running every earlier Copilot finding against the current
code as a regression suite instead of trusting the earlier verdicts.
Fifteen of sixteen still held; the heredoc case did not.

`_executable_command_lines()` has dropped heredoc bodies since the
installer checks were written - a heredoc body is data being printed,
not a command. `_pytest_command_lines()`, which every gate-coverage
assertion goes through, never had that rule. So all six spellings of a
heredoc hid a gate command from the coverage checks while the installer
checks caught the same text: `<<EOF`, `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`, `<<-EOF`, a
heredoc redirected into a file, and one inside a workflow `run:` block.

Measured on the real script, not synthetically: wrapping the whole of
Gate 5 - the plotting and hot-path real-ROOT gate, eight test files -
in `cat <<'GATE5' ... GATE5` leaves valid shell that prints the pytest
command and runs nothing, so `failures` stays at zero and the script
reports every gate passed. Against the pre-fix reader all three
coverage tests passed on that sabotage. Against the fixed reader two
of them fail.

This is the third instance of one defect: a rule that exists in one
reader and not the sibling reader that needs it. The first cost a
review round (the two pytest filter checks), the second was the
redundant `-p` rule removed yesterday. The fix follows the same
resolution as the first: `_outside_heredoc_bodies()` is one function
with two callers, rather than a second copy of the scan.

Checked for over-reach: all four readers give byte-identical output on
all twenty-five real shell and workflow sources, and the real sources
still yield the same pytest command lines (four in
`scripts/run_all_gates.sh`, one in `.githooks/pre-commit`, four in
`.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`).

### Verification performed

- The six heredoc spellings pinned as a test, each measured as counted
  before the fix and dropped after; `bash` confirmed to print rather
  than run a heredoc body.
- Two controls in the same test: a real gate command *after* a heredoc
  is still read as a command, and an unterminated heredoc swallows the
  rest of the file, which is what the shell does.
- The heredoc filter removed from the pytest pipeline with the test
  kept: it fails. Restored: it passes.

## 2026-09-09 — The mirror of the heredoc gap: an installer command inside a function nothing calls

The previous entry fixed a rule that existed in the installer reader
and not the gate reader. Checking the same pair the other way round
found the opposite gap. `_shell_invocation_lines()` dropped function
*definition* lines but kept the bodies, and
`_executable_command_lines()` - the view every "this installer really
does X" assertion reads - kept both.

Measured on the real `install.sh`: replacing its two build calls with
`true` leaves a valid installer that builds nothing at all, and all
forty-three policy tests still passed, because the two unreachable
function bodies were still being read as commands the installer runs.
With the fix, `test_install_script_is_non_destructive` fails on that
sabotage.

### Why this is not the same rule as the gate reader's

The first attempt applied the gate reader's rule - a command has to sit
at top level - to the installer view as well. Measured against the real
sources, that dropped over a hundred real commands from `install.sh`
and `scripts/install_pyBumpHunter.sh`, which put nearly everything they
do inside functions they do call: `require_file`, `verify_dependency`,
`build_cpp_dependency`, `fail`. The gate sources are the opposite -
every pytest command in all five gate invocations is already at top
level, `run_gate` receiving it as an argument - so the stronger rule
costs nothing there.

So the two readers keep different rules, deliberately and for a
measured reason, but share one implementation:
`_function_definition_spans(lines, only_uncalled=...)` returns each
definition's span, and `_outside_function_bodies()` drops either every
body or only the bodies of functions whose name is never used outside
their own span. Stated plainly in the docstring: whether a function is
*reachable* is a call-graph problem this does not solve - a name used
inside another function that nothing calls still counts as a call - so
it errs towards keeping a body rather than hiding one.

### The wrong first attempt, recorded

Applying the strict rule to the installer view was checked against all
twenty-five real shell and workflow sources before being kept, which is
how the over-reach was caught: six of them differed, listing the
hundred-plus commands it would have hidden. The comparison across all
real sources is now run for every change to these readers, and the
narrow rule passes it with zero differences.

One committed test changed rather than being added to: the guarded-body
case in `test_the_installer_views_reject_text_that_never_runs` used a
`run_build` that was never called, so under the new rule its body is
dropped before the `if false` check can see it. The case now calls
`run_build`, which is the realistic threat, and the uncalled variant is
pinned separately as producing no commands at all.

### Verification performed

- `install.sh` sabotaged at both build call sites and run against the
  pre-fix and fixed readers: 43 passed before, 1 failed after.
  Restored.
- The same sabotage attempted at one call site only, which proved
  nothing - the assertion was satisfied by a second `cmake --build` in
  the sibling function that is still called. Recorded because the first
  run looked like a clean pass.
- All four readers compared against all twenty-five real shell and
  workflow sources: zero differences.
- `only_uncalled=True` removed with the new cases kept: they fail.
  Restored: they pass.
- All twelve gate-reader forms re-measured after the refactor:
  unchanged, and the real sources still yield four pytest command lines
  in `scripts/run_all_gates.sh` and one in `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 247 collected, 227
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Test count unchanged, so the documented figures still hold.
- Under the LCG Python 3.9.12: 2 passed for the prepared-dependency
  gate.

## 2026-09-09 — Third audit pass: the two shell readers misread ordinary bash, and one of them was already doing it

Copilot's `rm report.txt` finding said the recursive-delete detector
accepted a pattern with no leading dash at all, so an ordinary operand
counted as a flag, and asked for the pattern to be made precise rather
than left over-inclusive. Applied as a class to the two readers added
in the two commits before this one, the same defect is in both, and in
one of them it is not hypothetical.

### A here-string is not a heredoc

`_HEREDOC_OPENER` searched for `<<` anywhere in a line. Three other
constructs spell it the same way, and all three were read as heredoc
openers:

- `<<<`, a here-string, whose operand is data on the same line rather
  than a body below it. `bc <<< 'scale=2; 30/1.015'` was read as a
  heredoc named `scale`, whose delimiter never appears again.
- `<<` inside an arithmetic expansion, where it is a left shift:
  `mask=$(( 1 << bits ))` opened a heredoc named `bits`.
- `<<` inside quotes, where it is text: `echo "write it as <<STOP"`.

Each then hid every line to the end of the file. Measured on the real
sources: 253 of `install.sh`'s 253 command lines, 42 of 42 in
`scripts/run_all_gates.sh`, 23 of 23 in `.githooks/pre-commit`. That
leaves the always-false-guard check with nothing to read at all, and
every "this file runs X" assertion failing on valid shell.

This one was already live. `scripts/run_anaFit_flowchart.sh` and
`scripts/run_nloFit_flowchart.sh` both contain
`scalefactor=$( bc <<< 'scale=2; 3.3/0.342' )`, and each was losing 24
real command lines to it. Neither file is read by a gate check today,
so nothing failed - but the construct is in this repository already,
not a hypothetical.

The fix scans the line the way the shell reads it: quoted spans
skipped, arithmetic expansions skipped, and `<<<` distinguished from
`<<` before a delimiter is read.

### An empty array initialisation is not a function definition

`_SHELL_FUNCTION_DEFINITION` excluded shell metacharacters from a
function name but not `=`, so `built_targets=()` matched as a
definition named `built_targets=`. It then took the following line as
the start of its body and dropped it; with a keyword-form definition on
that line, it took that function's whole body as its own.

Measured against bash: `built_targets=()` initialises an array and
`type built_targets` reports no such command; `foo=bar() { :; }` is a
syntax error, so no POSIX-form function name can contain `=`; but
`function foo=bar { :; }` does define a function. So `=` is excluded
from the POSIX form and kept in the keyword form, which is exactly what
bash accepts.

### The body ends where bash ends it

Fixing the first two exposed a third, in the same code. Heredoc removal
ran *after* continuations were joined, and `_join_continuations()`
strips each line, so the terminator could only ever be compared against
stripped text. Measured against bash: a plain `<<EOF` body ends only at
a line that is exactly the delimiter - an indented `  EOF` does not end
it, and neither does `EOF ` with a trailing space - while `<<-EOF`
accepts leading tabs and not leading spaces. Comparing stripped text
therefore ended a body early at an indented copy of its own delimiter,
and read the real command below it as a command the file runs.

The three rules are now one pass, `_command_text()`, because the order
they are applied in is itself a correctness question and applying them
separately got it wrong twice: a full-line comment has to go before
openers are looked for, or `# cat <<EOF` hides the rest of the file; a
body line has to be compared against its raw text, or a trailing
comment turns `EOF # done` into a terminator bash does not see; and the
body has to be found before continuations are joined, because joining
strips the indentation the exact match needs.

One consequence, found the same way: `_workflow_run_block_lines()`
returned a `run:` block at its YAML indentation, but YAML strips a
block scalar's indentation before the shell sees it. Once terminators
were matched exactly, an indented `EOF` in a run block no longer ended
its body and the real gate command below it disappeared. The reader now
strips the block's own indentation, which is what GitHub actually feeds
to bash.

### One committed fixture changed rather than added to

`test_executable_command_lines_ignores_comments_and_echoes` wrote its
heredoc at Python indentation, so its terminator was indented too. It
was passing because the body was never terminated, not because the body
was dropped - the right answer for the wrong reason. Its terminator is
now at column 0, the way bash requires and every real script writes it.

### Verification performed

- All four readers compared against all twenty-five real shell and
  workflow sources: four differences, all of them the intended fix -
  the two flowchart launchers gaining back the 24 command lines each
  had been losing. The six gate and installer sources: byte-identical.
- Every heredoc spelling re-measured against real bash before the fix
  was written: plain, quoted, double-quoted, `<<-` with tabs, `<<-`
  with spaces, a terminator with a trailing space, and an indented
  terminator.
- Four sabotages, each reverting one part of the fix, each confirmed to
  fail the new cases and to pass again when restored: the opener
  ignoring `<<<`/arithmetic/quotes, `=` allowed back into the POSIX
  name, the terminator matched with `strip()`, and the run block kept
  at its YAML indentation.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 247 collected, 227
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Existing tests extended rather than added, so the documented
  figures are unchanged.

## 2026-09-09 — Fourth audit pass: the always-false guard was applied to four of six sources, and the wiring check read the wrong order

Two findings, both of them Copilot comments applied as a class to the
code written in answer to those same comments.

### The guard rule reached four of the six real sources

Copilot's suppressed comment at `tests/test_repo_utils.py:917` said the
always-false-guard check was applied to the pre-commit hook and to
neither gate source, so wrapping a gate's pytest command in
`if false; then ... fi` left the coverage tests passing. The gate
sources were fixed. Sweeping the same rule across every reader shows it
was never applied to the other two:

- `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml`, whose `run:` block
  carries the entire lightweight quality gate. Confirmed by sabotage
  against the real file: both of its commands wrapped in
  `if false; then ... fi`, and
  `test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate` passed.
- `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`. Confirmed the same way: its
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` guarded, and both assertions
  about that command passed while the mandatory local hook is never
  installed.

Rather than add the call in two more places, every real source now goes
through one reader, `_gate_commands(text, description)`, which applies
the guard once. This is the third time a rule has been present in one
reader and absent in its sibling - the two pytest filter checks, the
heredoc rule, and now this - so it is also pinned structurally:
`test_every_real_source_is_read_through_the_guarded_reader` parses this
test file with `ast` and refuses any new caller of
`_executable_command_lines()` that is not on a named list. Adding a
reader now fails until someone decides about the guard, instead of
relying on remembering.

### The wiring check compared positions in a breadth-first walk

`test_the_lightweight_gate_applies_its_own_pytest_config_refusal` read
`_run_fast_checks()`'s calls with `ast.walk()` and compared their
positions in that walk. `ast.walk()` is breadth-first, not source
order, so a shallower call reads as earlier however late it really is.
Measured on synthetic source: with pytest started inside a conditional
above the refusal - the exact order the check exists to forbid - the
walk reported the refusal first and the assertion passed.

It now reads the function's own statements in order, and requires the
refusal to be a plain expression statement rather than anything
conditional: it has to run every time, before the first statement that
reaches `run_command`.

### A candidate checked and rejected

`effective_pytest_config_file()` was re-measured against real pytest
on nine configuration layouts, including the four it had not been
measured on: `tox.ini` with and without `[pytest]` beside a `setup.cfg`
carrying `[tool:pytest]`, a `pyproject.toml` with no `ini_options`
beside a `tox.ini` that has `[pytest]`, and `setup.cfg` alone. It
agrees with pytest on all of them.

The one divergence is an unparseable `pyproject.toml`: pytest exits 4
with `ERROR: ...: Invalid value`, while the gate raises
`TOMLDecodeError`. Both refuse loudly and neither can report a clean
pass, so this is left as it is rather than given a separate error path -
recorded because it was checked, not because it is a defect.

### Verification performed

- Both real sources sabotaged and restored: each is now rejected where
  it passed before.
- Four sabotages of the fix itself, each confirmed to fail and then to
  pass when restored: the guard removed from the shared reader, each of
  the two sources routed back around it, and the ordering check
  returned to `ast.walk()` positions.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 248 collected, 228
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. The documented figures in `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`,
  `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` and
  `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` are updated to match, and the
  prepared-dependency gate to 44 collected, 2 passed, 42 deselected.

## 2026-09-09 — Fifth audit pass: a command read as configuration, and an inventory that went stale a second time

The last two findings from reading every Copilot comment as a class
against the commits it never saw.

### The mirror of the YAML metadata finding

Copilot's comment on `tests/test_repo_utils.py:72` said whole-file YAML
was being searched for commands, so a step `name:` quoting a command
satisfied a coverage check after the real `run:` command was deleted.
That produced `_workflow_run_block_lines()`, which answers "does this
workflow run X" from `run:` blocks only.

The same file is also asked the opposite question - "is this workflow
configured with X" - and `_yaml_config_lines()` answered it from the
whole file, `run:` blocks included. So a command was read as
configuration, which is the same defect with the halves swapped.
Confirmed by sabotage on the real workflow: with
`python-version: "3.12.13"` repinned to `"3.9.0"` and its old text
moved into a `run: echo 'python-version: "3.12.13"'`, the assertion
that the lightweight CI gate is configured for 3.12.13 still passed
while CI would have run on Python 3.9.

The split is now made once, in `_workflow_lines()`, which returns both
halves; the two readers take one each. All five configuration
assertions in `test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate` were checked
against the clean file afterwards and are all satisfied by real YAML
keys outside any `run:` block - `uses:` twice, `python-version:`,
`cache-dependency-path:` and the `on.pull_request.branches` list.

### The inventory went stale again

Copilot's comment on `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md:149` said the document called
`python/repo_utils.py` a four-function utility while
`selection_affecting_addopts()` had been added. That was corrected to
six. Read as a class, the same sentence was stale again:
`pytest_addopts_words()` was public and unlisted, a seventh function
absent from a map that claims to name them all.

Nothing outside the module reads the words themselves - only
`selection_affecting_addopts()` does, in the same file - so it is now
`_pytest_addopts_words()`, named for what it is, alongside
`_load_toml()`, `_selection_option()` and
`_declares_pytest_configuration()`. The documented count of six is
correct as it stands.

Because that one sentence has now gone stale twice,
`test_the_documented_repo_utils_inventory_names_every_public_function`
reads the count and the names out of the module with `ast` and checks
the document against them. Both failure modes are covered: a public
function missing from the map, and a count that no longer matches.

### Verification performed

- The real workflow sabotaged and restored: repinned to 3.9.0 with the
  old pin moved into a `run: echo`, the configuration assertion passed
  before the fix and fails after it.
- Three sabotages of the fix, each confirmed to fail and to pass when
  restored: the configuration reader returned to reading the whole
  file, the addopts helper made public again while unlisted, and the
  documented count edited by hand to five.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 249 collected, 229
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Documented figures updated across the four living documents, and
  the prepared-dependency gate to 45 collected, 2 passed, 43
  deselected.

### Audit closed

All forty-four Copilot findings - twenty-six inline comments and
eighteen suppressed ones across thirteen reviews - have now been read
as defect classes and re-applied to every commit made since the last
review. Nine further defects were found and fixed this way, in three
commits; two candidates were checked and rejected with the measurement
recorded. No Copilot finding remains unaddressed, and no new Copilot
review has arrived since the one on `09f56ae`.

## 2026-09-09 — Sixth audit pass: the YAML splitter added in the fifth pass misread three block-scalar cases

The fifth pass split a workflow into the shell inside its `run:` blocks
and the YAML around it, because reading the whole file for either
question was unsound in both directions. That splitter is new code, and
no Copilot review has seen it: the last review is still the one on
`09f56ae`, submitted before any of the audit commits were pushed. So
the same findings were re-applied to the fix itself, and the same
generalisation rule that found the earlier defects found three more
here.

PyYAML is not among the locked development dependencies, so the
splitter has to be correct on its own rather than deferring to a
parser. It was checked against PyYAML 6.0.3 installed into a scratch
directory outside the project environment, purely as a measuring
instrument.

### A folded block is not one command per line

A `run: >` block is folded: YAML joins consecutive non-empty lines with
a single space, and only a blank line becomes a newline. So

```yaml
run: >
  echo "about to run"
  python -m pytest tests/test_pre_fit.py
```

reaches bash as one `echo` whose arguments happen to contain the word
pytest, and runs no tests at all. Read line by line it looked like an
echo that gets dropped followed by a real pytest invocation, and the
coverage checks called that step covered. This is the same defect class
as Copilot's comment on an echoed command being read as a command that
runs, arriving through the YAML layer rather than the shell one.

Confirmed silent by sabotage on the real file: with
`.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml`'s plotting-layer step
rewritten as a folded block - a step that, so written, really would run
one command and no tests - the pre-fix reader left
`test_ci_scientific_workflow_covers_every_requires_analysis_dependencies_test_file`
passing. Nothing else in the suite noticed either.

A folded block's lines are now folded the way YAML folds them, one
command per paragraph, before any command check sees them. A literal
`|` block is still one command per line, and a blank line inside a
folded block is still a break.

### Five spellings of a block header were read as inline commands

The previous test for "does this `run:` open a block" was whether what
followed it was empty once the characters `|>+-` were stripped. Measured
against PyYAML 6.0.3, that test is wrong for every header carrying an
indentation indicator or a comment: `|2`, `|2-`, `|-2`, `>2+` and
`| # note` are all accepted headers, as is a bare `run:`, which opens a
multi-line plain scalar that folds exactly as `>` does. Each was read
as an inline command instead, which moved the block's whole body out of
the command half of the split and into the YAML half - invisible to
every check that asks what the workflow runs, including the
always-false-guard refusal, and searched as configuration instead.

Sabotage on the real file records which direction this fails in: with
both of `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml`'s blocks written
as `|2`, the pre-fix reader failed
`test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate` outright, so on that file
it is loud. The silent direction is the other half of the split, where
command text arrives as configuration - the same false-positive path
the fifth pass had just closed.

The header is now matched as YAML defines it: the style character, then
an indentation indicator and a chomping indicator in either order, then
an optional comment. The indicator's own column arithmetic is
deliberately not modelled - it is relative to the parent node, and no
workflow here uses one - so the body's margin is still taken from its
content, which is what YAML does absent an indicator.

After the fix the splitter's `run:` lines were compared with what
PyYAML reports for every `run:` value in both real workflow files:
identical, 194 lines for `scientific-analysis.yml` and 3 for
`tier1-root-comparison.yml`, and each file still exposes exactly one
`python-version:` pin to the configuration reader.

### The structural check looked only inside functions

`test_every_real_source_is_read_through_the_guarded_reader`, also added
in the fifth pass, exists so that no new caller of
`_executable_command_lines()` can quietly skip the always-false guard.
It walked the module's function definitions, so a call at module scope
was invisible to it: a module-level constant built from a real source
would have been read with no guard applied and the check would have
reported no callers at all. That is the same class as Copilot's comment
on the decorator scanner missing forms it did not look for - a check
that passes because it looked in the wrong place.

Calls are now attributed to their enclosing function by descent rather
than by walking definitions, and a call in no function is attributed to
`"<module>"`, which is not on the exemption list and therefore fails. A
call inside a nested function is attributed to that nested function, so
it has to be named deliberately too rather than hiding behind whatever
encloses it.

### Only `run:` blocks were tracked, so other block scalars were read as YAML

Generalising the two fixes above one step further: the splitter tracked
a block scalar only under `run:`. Any other key's block body was read
line by line as ordinary YAML, and free text is neither commands nor
configuration. `actions/github-script`'s `script: |` is the realistic
case - its body is JavaScript - and a line inside such a body that
happens to read `run: <command>` counted as a step that runs the
command, while a line that happens to read `python-version: "..."`
counted as the workflow's pin. Both halves of the split wrong at once,
from one hole.

Every key is now matched, and a block scalar under any key other than
`run:` is dropped from both halves. A bare key with no `|` or `>` still
opens a mapping rather than a block, so ordinary configuration is
unaffected - checked explicitly, since treating `with:` as a block
would have discarded the very keys the configuration reader exists to
read.

### Verification performed

- Four sabotages of the fixes, each confirmed to fail exactly one test
  and to pass when restored: folded blocks read one command per line
  again, the old strip-based header test restored, the caller walk
  returned to visiting function definitions only, and block tracking
  narrowed back to `run:` keys.
- Two sabotages of the real workflow files, each measured against both
  the pre-fix and the post-fix reader, recorded above.
- The splitter's output compared line by line with PyYAML 6.0.3 across
  fifteen block-header spellings and both real workflow files.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 253 collected, 233
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Documented figures updated across the four living documents, and
  the prepared-dependency gate to 49 collected, 2 passed, 47
  deselected.

### On the previous entry's closing statement

The entry above closed the audit on the grounds that every Copilot
finding had been re-applied to every commit since the last review. That
was true of the commits that existed when it was written, and it did
not hold for long: the fifth pass's own fix was the newest unreviewed
code in the repository, and applying the findings to it produced these
four defects. The findings themselves remain fully swept - all
forty-four, as classes - and no new Copilot review has arrived. What is
now recorded, rather than closed, is that each pass adds code no review
has seen, so the sweep has a fixed point only when a pass finds nothing.

## 2026-09-09 — A quoted YAML key is the same key

Immediately after the entry above, the same generalisation applied once
more to the same regex. The splitter matched a bare key, so `"run": |`
and `'run': |` matched nothing. Both are valid YAML that GitHub Actions
runs, and both left the block's commands being read as configuration -
exactly the case the entry above had just fixed for the unquoted
spelling, in the one place the key itself is recognised. Measured
against PyYAML 6.0.3, which loads both.

The key may now carry a matched pair of quotes, and the block's column
is taken from the match rather than by searching the line for the key
text, so the quotes are accounted for rather than skipped. A mismatched
pair is not treated as a quoted key.

Two other spellings were measured and deliberately left alone: `run:|`
with no space, and a tab after the header. PyYAML rejects both, so a
workflow written that way never runs at all, and a reader that accepts
them cannot mislead anything.

### Verification performed

- The splitter's `run:` lines compared with PyYAML's across all
  forty-two combinations of three key spellings and fourteen block
  headers: identical throughout, and still identical to every `run:`
  value in both real workflow files.
- One sabotage of the fix - the key regex narrowed back to unquoted
  keys - confirmed to fail `test_every_block_scalar_header_opens_a_block`
  and to pass when restored.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 253 collected, 233
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. No documented figure changed, because the case was added to an
  existing test rather than a new one.

## 2026-09-09 — Where the workflow split stops, and saying so out loud

Two more YAML forms carry a `run:` command that a line-based split
cannot see, both measured against PyYAML 6.0.3:

- a flow mapping, `- {name: s, run: python -m pytest ...}`, whose
  command sits on a line that is not a `run:` key, so the whole line
  was read as configuration;
- an alias, `run: *cmd`, whose command is defined elsewhere in the
  file, so the run half received the text `*cmd` and nothing that
  looks for a command found one.

Both are valid YAML that GitHub Actions would run, and neither real
workflow file uses either. The previous three entries each widened a
regex to cover a spelling that had been missed, and this is where that
approach stops being the right one: the end of widening is a YAML
parser, and PyYAML is not among the locked development dependencies -
it was used in this pass as a measuring instrument, installed outside
the project environment, not added to it.

So the boundary is now drawn explicitly. `_workflow_lines()` refuses a
file containing either form, naming the line and saying why, rather
than reading it as if it were block style. The refusal lives in the
splitter itself, so no reader can be given a form it cannot read, and
the check runs against both real workflow files as well as the
synthetic cases - the same "one implementation, every caller" shape as
the always-false-guard refusal.

`run:|` with no space and a tab after the header were measured too and
deliberately left accepted: PyYAML rejects both outright, so a workflow
written that way never runs, and reading it cannot mislead anything.

### Verification performed

- One sabotage - the refusal unwired from `_workflow_lines()` -
  confirmed to fail `test_the_workflow_split_refuses_yaml_it_does_not_model`
  and to pass when restored.
- Both real workflow files pass the refusal, and their `run:` lines are
  still identical to PyYAML's.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 254 collected, 234
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Documented figures updated across the four living documents, and
  the prepared-dependency gate to 50 collected, 2 passed, 48
  deselected.

## 2026-09-09 — The refusal added last pass read shell as YAML

The previous entry drew a boundary: a workflow written in a form the
line-based split cannot read is refused rather than misread. That
refusal was applied to the whole file before the split, which is where
it went wrong - a block scalar's body is shell, not YAML. Measured
against the committed reader, three pieces of ordinary shell inside a
`run: |` block were each refused as a YAML form it does not model:

- `{ echo a; echo b; } > log`, a brace group, read as a flow mapping;
- a heredoc body carrying `paths: *default`, read as a YAML alias;
- a JSON object piped to `jq`, read as a flow mapping again.

None of that is YAML. It is the same mistake these readers exist to
prevent - text read as the wrong language - arriving inverted: not a
step's name read as a command, but a command read as YAML. It is the
loud direction, so it would have stopped the whole gate on a workflow
the reader can in fact read. The refusal now runs inside the split,
line by line, and only on the lines the split reads as YAML.

Checking the refusal against the forms it names then found it missing
the ones that matter. It matched a flow collection only at the start of
a line, so `- {name: s, run: cmd}` was refused while

    steps: [{name: s, run: python -m pytest tests/test_x.py}]
    step: {run: python -m pytest tests/test_x.py}

- both valid YAML that GitHub Actions runs - were read as ordinary
configuration with their commands silently lost: no run lines, no
refusal, no complaint. A flow collection is now refused wherever it
opens, in a value as well as at the start of a line, and a flow
sequence of settings (`python-version: [3.9, "3.12"]`) with it, since
two settings on one line cannot be read as configuration either. An
Actions expression is not a flow collection and is deliberately still
accepted: its brace follows a `$`.

Two further readings were measured wrong against PyYAML 6.0.3.

Folding does not apply to a more-indented line. The fifth pass modelled
the paragraph rule and stopped there, so every line of a folded block
was joined, and

    run: >
      echo "about to run"
        python -m pytest tests/test_x.py

was reported as one long echo that runs no tests, while YAML really
hands bash the pytest invocation on a line of its own. That is the
silent direction: a real command lost. The same two lines after a bare
`run:` are one command, because a plain scalar's folding ignores
indentation - so the scalar's style is now carried through the split
rather than a single folded flag, and all three styles are measured.

A step name spanning two lines leaked into the configuration half.
`_yaml_config_lines()` dropped the line carrying the `name:` key and
nothing else, so

    - name: install the pinned
        tier-2-m365 dependencies

left `tier-2-m365 dependencies` being read as configuration. Sabotaged
on the real `tier1-root-comparison.yml` - its trigger branch repinned
to `tier-9-none` and the old branch name moved into a two-line step
name - the committed reader still reported the workflow as configured
for `tier-2-m365`, so `test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate` would
have passed while CI ran on a branch the workflow no longer names.
Every continuation line of a plain scalar is now dropped, whichever key
opened it: a line that is neither a key nor a sequence item carries no
setting of its own. A block sequence's items are values, and stay.

### Verification performed

- The reader's `run:` lines compared with PyYAML's across 381 valid
  combinations of three key spellings, sixteen block headers and eight
  body shapes, including more-indented and blank lines: identical
  throughout, and still identical to every `run:` value in both real
  workflow files. Three further combinations PyYAML rejects outright.
- Five sabotages, each confirmed to fail exactly one test and to pass
  when restored. The whole-file refusal restored fails
  `test_shell_inside_a_run_block_is_not_read_as_yaml`; the flow
  collection narrowed back to line-initial fails
  `test_the_workflow_split_refuses_yaml_it_does_not_model`; folding a
  more-indented line, and treating a plain scalar as a folded block,
  each fail `test_a_folded_block_does_not_fold_a_more_indented_line`;
  the continuation rule removed fails
  `test_a_step_name_spanning_two_lines_is_not_configuration`.
- Neither real workflow file uses a flow collection, an anchor or an
  alias, and neither contains a line that is neither a key nor a
  sequence item, so all four defects were dormant on the files as
  written today.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 257 collected, 237
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Documented figures updated across the four living documents, and
  the prepared-dependency gate to 53 collected, 2 passed, 51
  deselected.

## 2026-09-09 — Naming the command reader is using it

`_callers_of()` exists to force every new place that reads a real gate
or installer source to decide about the always-false guard: adding a
caller fails
`test_every_real_source_is_read_through_the_guarded_reader` unless the
caller is named in `_UNGUARDED_COMMAND_READERS` deliberately. It looked
for calls, and only for calls, so two ways of handing the reader a real
source reported no caller at all:

    SOURCES = list(map(_executable_command_lines, real_sources))
    reader = _executable_command_lines

Neither writes a call whose callee is that name. Both read every source
with the guard unapplied while the check reported nothing to decide
about - a check that misses the form rather than the rule, which is the
same shape as the block headers and the quoted keys in the entries
above. Naming the reader now counts as using it.

The same walk attributed a use in a decorator or a default argument to
the function being defined, although both are evaluated where the
function is defined rather than when it is called. That let the
exemption list hide the case it exempts: naming a decorated test in
`_UNGUARDED_COMMAND_READERS` would have exempted a read happening at
import time. Definition-time uses are now attributed to the enclosing
scope, which at module level is `<module>` - a name the exemption list
does not contain.

### Verification performed

- Four spellings measured against the committed walk and the fixed one:
  passed by name, aliased, used in a decorator, used in a default
  argument. All four reported no caller before and `<module>` after,
  and a plain call inside a function is still attributed to that
  function.
- Two sabotages, each confirmed to fail
  `test_the_guarded_reader_check_sees_a_use_that_is_not_a_call` and to
  pass when restored: the name detection removed, and the decorator
  attributed to the decorated function again.
- Every use of `_executable_command_lines()` in this file is a direct
  call, so the widened rule adds no caller and
  `_UNGUARDED_COMMAND_READERS` is unchanged - the fix closes a hole
  without loosening anything.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 258 collected, 238
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Documented figures updated across the four living documents, and
  the prepared-dependency gate to 54 collected, 2 passed, 52
  deselected.

## 2026-09-09 — The conditional-step check was a second workflow reader

`_yaml_conditions()` refuses a workflow that makes a step or job
conditional, because a condition can skip a gate while every command
stays on the page. It read the workflow's raw text with a line-anchored
`if:` pattern, and so was a second reader of the same file that never
went through the split - which meant the refusal drawn two entries ago
never applied to it. Three spellings of a really conditional step were
invisible to it, all three confirmed with PyYAML 6.0.3 to load with a
real `if` key:

    - {name: s, if: false, run: make test}
      "if": false
      'if': false

The flow mapping is the same form the split refuses; read as raw text
it simply reported no condition. The two quoted keys are the same key,
missed here for exactly the reason `"run": |` was missed by the
block-scalar reader - the finding that produced its own entry above,
unapplied to this pattern because nothing had looked at this pattern
since.

The detector now reads the configuration half of the split, so the
refusal reaches it and a flow mapping fails loudly instead of being
reported as unconditional, and it accepts a quoted `if:` key.

Making that change exposed one more swallow in the split itself: a
block scalar under a key other than `run:` had its key line dropped
along with its body. Only the body is free text - the key is
configuration - and with the key gone a condition written as `if: >`
would have disappeared from the very check being wired up here. The key
line now stays in the configuration half.

### Verification performed

- Six spellings of a condition measured against the committed detector
  and the fixed one: block style plain, both quoted keys, `if: >`,
  `if: |`, and the flow mapping. The three that were invisible are now
  reported or refused; the two block-scalar spellings still report, and
  an unconditional workflow still reports nothing.
- Three sabotages, each confirmed to fail exactly the intended test and
  to pass when restored: the detector reading raw text again, and the
  quoted key dropped, both fail
  `test_a_conditional_step_is_recognised_however_it_is_written`; the
  block scalar's key line dropped again fails that test and
  `test_a_block_scalar_under_another_key_is_neither_commands_nor_config`.
- Both real workflow files report no condition, before and after, and
  their `run:` lines are still identical to PyYAML's.
- Eight more block-header spellings checked for the opposite error, a
  form read as a header that PyYAML does not accept: `|#note`, `| note`,
  `|-+`, `|+-`, `|2 3`, `>>`, `|0` and `|9`. PyYAML rejects every one of
  them outright, so a workflow written that way never runs and reading
  it either way cannot mislead a check - the same conclusion reached for
  `run:|` and a tab after the header, and the reason none of them is
  worth further widening.
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`: 259 collected, 239
  passed, 20 deselected, Ruff clean, Black clean (39 files), exit code
  0. Documented figures updated across the four living documents, and
  the prepared-dependency gate to 55 collected, 2 passed, 53
  deselected.

### On the seven passes so far

Every pass has found defects in the code the previous pass added, and
this one is no different: four of the eight defects fixed today are in
the fixes committed yesterday, including the refusal that was meant to
mark where the reader stops. That is not an argument against the
passes - each defect was real, and two would have let a broken CI
configuration report itself as correct - but it is an argument against
reading any of these entries as a closing statement. The sweep is
finished when a pass finds nothing. This one found eight.
