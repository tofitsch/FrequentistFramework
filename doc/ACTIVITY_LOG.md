## 2026-07-28 — Tier-1 baseline hardening (J100/J50 Run-2 workflow)

### Objective
Make the repository more workable first (Tier 1), using the authoritative Run-2 workflow:

- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Baseline workflow/repo audit completed**
   - Confirmed the authoritative scripts are present and tracked.
   - Confirmed required Run-2 input ROOT files exist:
     - `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J100_dataAll.root`
     - `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J50_dataAll.root`
   - Confirmed reference artifacts are present under `tests/references/`.

2. **`scripts/quality_check.py` strengthened with Tier-1 baseline checks**
   - Added required path validation for critical workflow files and reference artifacts.
   - Added optional workflow hint checks (non-fatal) for setup helpers.
   - Added explicit Python tool availability checks for:
     - `pytest`
     - `ruff`
     - `black`
   - Improved failure mode to be actionable (clear install guidance), rather than failing with opaque import/runtime errors.

3. **`doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` rewritten to match authoritative workflow**
   - Updated documentation focus from legacy/general flow to J100/J50 Run-2 execution.
   - Added Tier-1 baseline checklist aligned with `quality_check.py`.
   - Clarified scope boundaries and current known limitation:
     - `python/analysis_reference.py` still contains legacy fallback directory discovery (`run_135_1000_*`) and has not yet been fully migrated to prefer J100/J50 outputs first.

### Verification performed

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/quality_check.py`
  - Result: **success** (`syntax_ok`)
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`
  - Result: **12 passed**
- `python3 scripts/quality_check.py`
  - Result: expected environment failure message indicating missing `ruff` and `black` with install guidance.

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Pending: add environment pinning artifact (`requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`).
- Pending: migrate/extend `python/analysis_reference.py` to prioritize J100/J50 outputs.
- Pending: refresh frozen references/tests if migration changes output discovery.
- Pending: rerun full quality gate once lint/format tools are available in the active environment.

### Process note

From this point onward, each substantial activity will append a new dated section to this file summarizing:

- what changed,
- why it changed,
- how it was verified,
- and what remains.

## 2026-07-28 — Tier-1 completion planning + scope lock (background-only first)

### Objective
Capture the substantial Tier-1 planning and verification work completed after baseline hardening, while keeping the repo-workable-first constraint and authoritative Run-2 J100/J50 workflow fixed.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Tier-1 completion scope was clarified and locked with the user**
   - Confirmed execution priority remains strict Tier order: Tier 1 -> Tier 4.
   - Confirmed authoritative workflow remains:
     - `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
     - `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`
   - Confirmed delivery scope decision for current Tier-1 completion work:
     - **Background-only J100/J50 first**
     - **CLs workflow as a later Tier-1 extension**

2. **Repository/runtime evidence gathering for Tier-1 migration was completed**
   - Reviewed `python/analysis_reference.py` and confirmed legacy fallback discovery still targets `run/fits/...run_135_1000_(six|seven)Par` patterns.
   - Reviewed `tests/test_analysis_reference.py` and confirmed existing fixtures/assertions are still centered on legacy sixPar paths.
   - Inspected existing Run-2 outputs under:
     - `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/...`
     - `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/...`
   - Read J100 background-only quickFit log to establish current numerical/convergence behavior context before tightening regression criteria.

3. **Tier-1 implementation/testing plan prepared for next execution phase**
   - Planned migration of golden-master discovery and tests toward deterministic J100/J50-first behavior.
   - Planned preservation of tolerance-aware comparisons to protect against benign fit-level numeric jitter.
   - Planned separation of fast checks vs heavier/full checks as part of Tier-1 gate maturation.

### Verification performed

- Verified current activity log coverage by re-reading `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` before appending this entry.
- Verified the planning basis against current repository files and existing run artifacts (no contradictory evidence found).

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Pending: add environment pinning artifact (`requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`).
- Pending: migrate `python/analysis_reference.py` to deterministic J100/J50-first discovery for background-only outputs.
- Pending: update tests/references to match J100/J50-first behavior.
- Pending: formalize tolerance checks where needed for stable regression assertions.
- Pending: complete fast-vs-full Tier-1 gate split and document usage.

### Process note

- User instruction reaffirmed and adopted as an ongoing rule:
  - "please be sure to add all changes to the acvitvity log"
- Going forward, every substantial repository or workflow change will be appended here as a new dated section.

---

## 2026-07-29 — Activity-log correction: explicit titled section added

### Objective
Correct the missing titled entry for the latest work record and keep this log compliant with the rule to append substantial changes as dated sections.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Confirmed missing titled update section**
   - Re-read `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` and verified no new dated section existed beyond the two 2026-07-28 entries.

2. **Added an explicit titled dated section**
   - Appended this 2026-07-29 section so the most recent correction is clearly identifiable by title and date.

### Verification performed

- Re-read `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` after editing and confirmed this header is present:
  - `## 2026-07-29 — Activity-log correction: explicit titled section added`

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Pending: complete and verify the actual Tier-1 implementation deliverables (tests, environment pinning, quality-gate evolution) with concrete command outputs and file diffs.
- Pending: continue appending each substantial change as a new dated section in this log.

---

## 2026-07-29 — Tier-1 completion: provenance artifact + fast/full gate verification

### Objective
Complete the remaining Tier-1 implementation items for the authoritative J100/J50 Run-2 baseline by:

- recording environment provenance/pinning evidence,
- aligning Tier-1 system documentation with implemented behavior,
- executing and recording verification commands,
- preserving background-only-first scope with CLs deferred.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Environment provenance/pinning artifact added**
   - Added `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`.
   - Recorded runtime and tooling evidence captured from bounded probes:
     - `python_executable = /usr/bin/python3`
     - `python_version = 3.9.25`
     - `pyproject requires-python = >=3.11`
     - `pytest = 8.4.2`, `ruff = missing`, `black = missing`
     - `root-config --version = 6.40.02`
     - `ROOT` module discoverability present
     - prior bounded PyROOT probe evidence: RooFit available
   - Recorded authoritative path checks for J100/J50 background-only logs and optional `BHresults.json` absence.

2. **Tier-1 system documentation updated to current implementation**
   - Updated `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` to reflect real quality-gate usage:
     - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode fast`
     - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
   - Documented explicit fast/full semantics and their dependency checks.
   - Updated `python/analysis_reference.py` description to current deterministic J100/J50 background-only behavior.
   - Linked `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` from the system document.
   - Kept scope boundary explicit: CLs remains a follow-up extension.

3. **Tier-1 verification command sequence executed and captured**
   - `python3 -m py_compile scripts/quality_check.py`
     - Result: success (`__RC_PYCOMPILE__=0`)
   - `python3 -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`
     - Result: success (`13 passed`, `__RC_PYTEST__=0`)
   - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode fast`
     - Result: success (`13 passed`, `__RC_FAST__=0`)
   - `python3 scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
     - Result: expected actionable tooling failure (`__RC_FULL__=2`) due to missing `ruff`/`black`, with install guidance emitted by the script.

### Troubleshooting/process notes

- Direct PyROOT import probes intermittently exceeded command timeout bounds in this environment.
- To avoid blocking Tier-1 completion, provenance evidence was gathered through bounded checks (`root-config`, module discoverability, prior successful bounded probe results) and documented transparently.

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Tier-1 documentation/provenance and gate verification are now recorded.
- Remaining operational environment gap: active interpreter/runtime tooling still does not satisfy full lint/format stack (`ruff`, `black`) and is below declared Python baseline (`>=3.11`).
- CLs integration remains intentionally deferred per background-only-first scope.

---

## 2026-07-29 — Tier-1 system documentation expansion implemented

### Objective
Implement the planned expansion of `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` so Tier-1 users have a complete, implementation-aligned operating guide for the authoritative J100/J50 Run-2 baseline.

### Substantial changes completed

1. **Expanded Tier-1 system guide to cover end-to-end user operations**
   - Reworked `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` into a structured guide with:
     - purpose/audience/status,
     - Tier-1 goals and success criteria,
     - authoritative workflow/data surface,
     - Tier-1 repository map,
     - explicit quality-gate behavior (`--mode fast|full`, required paths, optional hints, exit semantics),
     - analysis-reference contract and schema expectations,
     - operating procedures, troubleshooting, reproducibility, and scope boundaries.

2. **Aligned documentation to source-of-truth implementation details**
   - Verified alignment to:
     - `scripts/quality_check.py` for required paths, optional hint paths, mode behavior, and tooling checks.
     - `python/analysis_reference.py` for workflow fit directories, log-selection behavior, supported fit-parameter names, and required payload keys.
     - `tests/references/analysis_reference.json` for current frozen baseline semantics (`J100`/`J50`, `cls_limit_points: []`, `p_bh: null`, `p_chi2: null`).

### Verification performed

- Consistency probe command (Python import/readback of Tier-1 constants + frozen reference keys)
  - Result: documentation-critical values matched implementation/reference data.
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`
  - Result: **13 passed**.
- `grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`
  - Result: no trailing whitespace (`__TRAILING_WS__=none`).

### Current status / remaining Tier-1 items

- Tier-1 system documentation expansion is complete and verified against current code/reference behavior.
- Remaining environment gap is unchanged: active runtime still lacks `ruff`/`black` and is below declared Python baseline (`>=3.11`) for full-mode parity.
- CLs integration remains intentionally deferred per background-only-first scope.

## 2026-07-30 — Tier-2 Python quality tooling and formatting baseline

### Objective

Establish a supported, reproducible project-local Python environment and enable
the complete pytest, Ruff, and Black quality-gate workflow.

### Substantial changes completed

- Recreated the repository-local virtual environment using Python 3.12.13.
- Installed pytest, Ruff, and Black into the same active interpreter environment.
- Added explicit development dependency records:
  - `requirements-dev.txt`
  - `requirements-dev-lock.txt`
- Added Git ignore exceptions so the development dependency records are
  intentionally version-controlled despite the repository-wide `*.txt` rule.
- Applied Ruff's safe automatic fixes to the explicit Tier-1 source and test targets.
- Applied Black formatting to the explicit Tier-1 source and test targets.
- Preserved unrelated working-tree content outside the Tier-2 staged changes.

### Environment evidence

- Python: `Python 3.12.13`
- Python executable: `/afs/cern.ch/user/h/hhook/FrequentistFramework/.venv/bin/python`
- pytest: `pytest 9.1.1`
- Ruff: `ruff 0.16.0`
- Black: `python -m black, 26.5.1 (compiled: yes)`

### Verification performed

- Command:
  `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
- Full quality-gate status: **success**
- Full quality-gate exit code: **0**
- Complete command output captured temporarily at:
  `/tmp/frequentist_framework_tier2_full_gate.log`

### Current status / remaining items

- Verify that the development environment can be recreated from requirements-dev-lock.txt.
- Continue recording substantial Tier-2 changes as new dated sections.

### 2026-07-30 — Tier-2 completion status and remaining work

#### Objective

Consolidate the Tier-2 environment, dependency, formatting, verification, and Git-integration work completed to date, and define the remaining acceptance criteria required before Tier 2 can be marked complete.

#### Significant work completed

- Established a repository-local virtual environment using Python 3.12.13, satisfying the declared Python 3.11-or-newer project requirement.
- Installed the quality-tooling stack into the same active environment:
  - pytest 9.1.1
  - Ruff 0.16.0
  - Black 26.5.1
- Added version-controlled development dependency records:
  - `requirements-dev.txt`
  - `requirements-dev-lock.txt`
- Added `.gitignore` exceptions for the dependency records because the repository otherwise ignores files matching `*.txt`.
- Applied Ruff's safe fixes for import ordering and missing final newlines.
- Applied Black formatting to the explicit Tier-1 source and test targets.
- Resolved all previously reported Ruff diagnostics without an intended behavioural change.
- Verified that all 13 targeted Tier-1 regression tests pass.
- Verified that Ruff and Black checks pass over the configured targets.
- Verified that the complete quality gate exits with code 0 on LXPlus.
- Preserved unrelated working-tree content by using explicit Git paths.
- Kept generated `post_fit.pdf` outputs outside the current Tier-2 scope.

#### Verified environment

- Python: `Python 3.12.13`
- Python executable: `/afs/cern.ch/user/h/hhook/FrequentistFramework/.venv/bin/python`
- pytest: `pytest 9.1.1`
- Ruff: `ruff 0.16.0`
- Black: `python -m black, 26.5.1 (compiled: yes)`

#### Verification evidence

The complete quality gate was run with:

```bash
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

Results:

- Targeted tests: **13 passed**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black check: **passed**
- Full quality-gate exit code: **0**

#### Remaining work required to complete Tier 2

1. **Update environment provenance**
   - Update `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` with the verified Python 3.12.13 project environment.
   - Record pytest 9.1.1, Ruff 0.16.0, and Black 26.5.1.
   - Preserve the previous Python 3.9.25 snapshot as historical evidence rather than describing it as the active project environment.

2. **Verify clean dependency-lock reproduction**
   - Create a fresh Python 3.12 virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies from `requirements-dev-lock.txt`.
   - Verify the installed Python, pytest, Ruff, and Black versions.
   - Run the complete quality gate in the clean environment.
   - Require a full-gate exit code of 0.

3. **Configure branch upstream tracking**
   - Fetch the remote branch list.
   - Determine whether `origin/tier-2-m365` exists.
   - If it exists, configure it as the upstream branch.
   - If it does not exist, publish the local branch with `git push -u origin tier-2-m365`.

4. **Synchronise the branch**
   - Pull remote changes using an explicit strategy such as `git pull --rebase`.
   - Confirm that all Tier-2 commits remain present after synchronisation.

5. **Perform final verification**
   - Activate the intended project virtual environment.
   - Run the complete quality gate again.
   - Record the final command output and exit code.

6. **Record final completion evidence**
   - Append a new dated activity-log section containing the clean-environment reproduction result, provenance update, branch status, and final gate result.
   - Mark Tier 2 complete only after both the clean reproduction environment and final project environment return full-gate exit code 0.

#### Deferred generated-output decision

The following generated files are not required for the current Tier-2 work:

- `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/post_fit.pdf`
- `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/post_fit.pdf`

Whether these files should remain tracked, be removed from tracking, or be ignored will be handled separately. Until then, avoid repository-wide staging commands such as `git add .` and `git commit -a`.

#### Tier-2 completion criteria

Tier 2 will be complete when:

- Python 3.11 or newer is active and documented;
- pytest, Ruff, and Black are reproducibly pinned;
- `requirements-dev-lock.txt` recreates a working clean environment;
- all 13 targeted tests pass;
- Ruff passes;
- Black check passes;
- the complete quality gate exits with code 0;
- `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` reflects the verified environment;
- `tier-2-m365` tracks the intended remote branch;
- final verification evidence is recorded in this activity log;
- unrelated generated outputs remain outside the Tier-2 change history.


### 2026-07-31 — Tier-2 completion: reproducible Python quality environment

#### Objective

Complete Tier 2 by proving clean dependency-lock reproduction, updating
environment provenance, configuring branch tracking, and verifying the
complete quality gate in both the clean reproduction environment and the
intended project environment.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Recreated a fresh Python 3.12 virtual environment outside the repository.
- Installed the development dependencies from `requirements-dev-lock.txt`.
- Verified that the locked dependencies reproduce the intended pytest,
Ruff, and Black toolchain.
- Configured `tier-2-m365` to track `origin/tier-2-m365`.
- Added a branch-specific `origin` fetch refspec for `tier-2-m365`.
- Verified that the local and remote branch tips were identical.
- Updated `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md` with the current supported
environment and clean-reproduction evidence.
- Preserved the Python 3.9.25 environment as a historical pre-Tier-2
snapshot.
- Kept unrelated generated outputs outside the Tier-2 change set.

#### Clean-environment verification

- Verification timestamp: 2026-07-30T16:07:19+02:00
- Python executable:
`/tmp/hhook/tmp.2Vv9EivLbA/tier2-clean-venv/bin/python`
- Python: 3.12.13
- pytest: 9.1.1
- Ruff: 0.16.0
- Black: 26.5.1
- Dependency source: `requirements-dev-lock.txt`
- Targeted tests: 13 passed in 0.21 seconds
- Ruff check: passed
- Black check: passed
- Full quality-gate exit code: 0

#### Branch verification

- Upstream branch: `origin/tier-2-m365`
- Local commit at synchronization:
`a7e8db56408a2413122af0e4a6880b3580012f07`
- Upstream commit at synchronization:
`a7e8db56408a2413122af0e4a6880b3580012f07`
- Branch divergence: none

#### Final project-environment verification

- Python: 3.12.13
- pytest: 9.1.1
- Ruff: 0.16.0
- Black: 26.5.1
- Targeted tests: 13 passed
- Ruff check: passed
- Black check: passed
- Full quality-gate exit code: 0
- Gate output:
`/tmp/frequentist_framework_tier2_final_gate.log`

#### Completion status

Tier 2 is complete. The project now has a supported Python environment,
a reproducibly pinned development toolchain, a passing complete quality
gate, updated environment provenance, and a synchronized tracked branch.

CLs integration, broader structural refactoring, orchestration, and the
generated-output policy remain outside Tier 2.

### 2026-07-31 — Modular Tier-1 and Tier-2 checker LXPlus verification and scope correction

#### Objective

Verify the newly added modular Tier-1 and Tier-2 check framework on LXPlus using the supported project environment, identify checker-specific failures, and preserve the established Tier-2 quality scope.

#### Substantial changes and verification completed

- Copied the modular `tier_checks/` framework into the LXPlus repository checkout.
- Confirmed that the framework contains 26 Python files under `tier_checks/`.
- Confirmed that the separate framework test file, `tests/test_tier_checks.py`, was not copied and remains to be restored before the framework is marked complete.
- Activated the supported repository-local Python environment.
- Verified the active toolchain:
  - Python 3.12.13
  - pytest 9.1.1
  - Ruff 0.16.0
  - Black 26.5.1
- Confirmed that automatic discovery finds all 12 modular checks:
  - six Tier-1 checks;
  - six Tier-2 checks.
- Ran the complete fast check mode.
- Fast-mode result:
  - PASS: 7
  - FAIL: 0
  - WARN: 0
  - SKIP: 5
- The five skipped checks were the expected in-depth-only checks.

#### In-depth verification results

The complete in-depth suite was run on LXPlus.

The following Tier-1 checks passed:

- program locations;
- deterministic reference regeneration;
- frozen-reference schema;
- targeted regression tests;
- J100/J50 workflow input contracts;
- J100/J50 recorded workflow outputs.

The targeted Tier-1 regression suite passed with 13 tests.

The following recorded background-only output logs were found and were non-empty:

- `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/quickFitLog_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.log`
- `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/quickFitLog_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.log`

The following Tier-2 checks passed:

- development dependency files;
- supported Python environment;
- pinned pytest, Ruff, and Black versions;
- the existing complete quality gate.

The authoritative complete quality gate passed with:

- 13 targeted tests passed;
- Ruff passed;
- Black passed;
- exit code 0.

The initial modular in-depth result was:

- PASS: 10
- FAIL: 2
- WARN: 0
- SKIP: 0
- exit code: 1

#### Diagnosed modular-check failures

The two failures were confined to the newly added standalone Ruff and Black wrapper checks.

The Black wrapper invoked:

```text
python -m black --check .
```

This incorrectly expanded the check to the complete repository. It attempted to process unrelated legacy Python files, Markdown files, ROOT binary files, and other files outside the established Tier-2 scope.

The Ruff wrapper invoked:

```text
python -m ruff check .
```

This also inspected the complete repository and reported findings in files outside the established Tier-2 target set.

These failures do not indicate a failure of the established Tier-2 quality gate. The existing `scripts/quality_check.py` continued to pass because it uses the intended explicit list of seven Tier-1 source and test targets.

#### Partial correction performed

- Began correcting the modular Ruff and Black checks so that they use an explicit quality-target list rather than the repository root.
- Ran Black on the new `tier_checks/` directory.
- Black reformatted 16 new checker Python files.
- Black then exited with code 123 because `tier_checks/README.md` was also passed to Black and was incorrectly parsed as Python.
- No repository-wide formatting was applied.
- No unrelated legacy source files, ROOT files, or generated analysis outputs were modified by Black.
- The correction is not yet complete.

#### Current status and remaining work

The modular framework is operational, all Tier-1 checks pass on LXPlus, and the authoritative Tier-2 quality gate remains fully passing.

The following work remains before the modular checker can be marked complete:

- Update the Ruff wrapper to receive only the authoritative Tier-2 Python targets and explicit `*.py` files under `tier_checks/`.
- Update the Black wrapper to receive only the authoritative Tier-2 Python targets and explicit `*.py` files under `tier_checks/`.
- Ensure that neither wrapper receives `.` or the complete `tier_checks/` directory as a formatting target.
- Run Black against the explicit checker Python-file list.
- Run Ruff against the explicit checker Python-file list.
- Recompile the checker package.
- Confirm that all 12 checks remain discoverable.
- Rerun the Tier-2 in-depth suite.
- Rerun the complete Tier-1 and Tier-2 in-depth suite.
- Require a final result of 12 passed, 0 failed, 0 warnings, and 0 skipped.
- Restore `tests/test_tier_checks.py`.
- Run the framework-specific tests and require two tests to pass.
- Review all changes before staging.
- Keep temporary reports, copied archives, unrelated generated files, and `post_fit.pdf` outputs outside the commit.

#### Scope boundary

The checker did not launch the complete J100 or J50 fit workflows. Verification remained limited to recorded paths, input and output contracts, existing background-only outputs, deterministic reference regeneration, regression tests, development tooling, and the established quality gate.

### 2026-07-31 — Tier-1 review feedback: strict reference validation

#### Objective

Resolve merge-review feedback for the Tier-1 analysis-reference validator and add regression coverage for the new failure modes.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Updated `python/analysis_reference.py` to reject unexpected top-level workflows in addition to missing required workflows.
- Updated workflow-payload validation to reject unexpected keys rather than silently discarding them.
- Updated optional `BHresults.json` handling to:
  - convert JSON decoding and file-read failures into clear `ValueError` exceptions;
  - reject valid JSON whose top-level payload is not an object;
  - preserve the existing validation of `pyBHresult` and `global_Pval`.
- Added five focused regression tests to `tests/test_analysis_reference.py` covering:
  - unexpected workflows;
  - unexpected workflow payload keys;
  - malformed BH JSON;
  - non-object BH JSON;
  - `OSError` while reading `BHresults.json`.
- Removed the accidentally added `test.md` file before merge.

#### Verification performed

- Black passed for the changed implementation and test files.
- Ruff passed for the changed implementation and test files.
- The complete targeted Tier-1 test set was run with:

  `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_reference.py tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py tests/test_repo_utils.py -q`

- Result: **18 tests passed in 0.42 seconds**.
- The reviewed changes were committed as:
  - `74ef39bda848b558bf3eb74a5f4bd0c077f78a65`
  - `Address Tier-1 analysis reference review feedback`
- Pull request #4 was merged into `upstream/harry` at merge commit:
  - `cb691d7`

#### Scope

The changes are limited to Tier-1 reference validation, its regression tests, activity-log documentation, and removal of the accidental `test.md` file.

The authoritative J100/J50 background-only workflow lock remains unchanged. CLs integration remains deferred.

### 2026-08-20: Tier-1 executable characterization safety foundation

#### Objective

Prepare the authoritative J100 and J50 workflows for a trustworthy executable characterization gate.

The intended final gate must rerun:

- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`

in fresh isolated output directories, then extract and compare the newly generated scientific results against frozen references.

This work focused on preventing false-positive test results before attempting the full analysis reruns.

#### Substantial changes completed

- **Added isolated output-directory support**
  - Updated `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`.
  - Updated `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`.
  - Both launchers now use `ANAFIT_OUTPUT_DIR` when it is provided.
  - The existing default output root, `run/fits`, remains unchanged for normal user execution.
  - This allows future integration tests to write into fresh temporary directories instead of overwriting or reusing committed outputs.

- **Corrected analysis return-status propagation**
  - Updated `python/run_anaFit.py` so `main()` returns the result from `run_anaFit()`.
  - Previously, the return value was discarded, allowing a failed analysis to appear as a successful process exit.
  - Analysis failures can now propagate through Python to the shell launcher and eventually to pytest.

- **Added mandatory external-command validation**
  - Added `execute_required()` to `python/run_anaFit.py`.
  - The helper rejects:
    - commands that return a nonzero exit status;
    - commands that return success without creating their required output files.
  - This establishes a consistent contract for mandatory scientific commands and their artifacts.

- **Hardened XMLReader workspace generation**
  - XMLReader is now treated as mandatory.
  - A nonzero XMLReader exit status terminates the analysis.
  - A successful exit without the expected workspace file also terminates the analysis.
  - The previous warning-and-continue behavior was removed from this path.

- **Hardened quickFit execution**
  - quickFit is now treated as mandatory.
  - A nonzero quickFit exit status terminates the analysis.
  - A successful exit without the expected fit-result file or quickFit log also terminates the analysis.
  - This prevents later extraction from consuming missing, incomplete, or stale fit outputs.

- **Added launcher-level failure propagation**
  - Both authoritative shell launchers now inspect the exit status from `python/run_anaFit.py`.
  - A failed Python analysis causes the launcher to print an error and exit with the same nonzero status.
  - Later plotting commands are not allowed to hide an earlier analysis failure.

- **Added focused regression tests**
  - Added `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
  - Added the new test file to the explicit test targets in `scripts/quality_check.py`.
  - The tests use controlled dependency stubs and do not run ROOT, XMLReader, quickFit, BumpHunter, or the full J100/J50 workflows.
  - Current coverage verifies:
    - successful analysis-status propagation;
    - failed analysis-status propagation;
    - acceptance of a successful mandatory command with its required output;
    - rejection of a nonzero mandatory-command status;
    - rejection of a missing required output;
    - termination after XMLReader failure, before quickFit starts;
    - termination after quickFit failure, before ROOT-based extraction starts.

#### Verification performed

- Baseline branch:
  - `tier-2-m365`
- Pre-change baseline commit:
  - `d50e925a1dad14ebb9254f50c90afe88a0415964`

- Focused regression tests:
  - Command: `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q`
  - Result: **7 passed**

- Python syntax validation:
  - Command: `python -m py_compile python/run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: exit code **0**
  - Six pre-existing invalid-regex-escape `SyntaxWarning` messages remain in the legacy analysis file.

- Ruff validation:
  - Checked `scripts/quality_check.py` and `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
  - Result: **passed**

- Black validation:
  - Checked `scripts/quality_check.py` and `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
  - Result: **passed**
  - Both files were already correctly formatted.

- Shell syntax validation:
  - `bash -n scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
  - Result: exit code **0**
  - `bash -n scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`
  - Result: exit code **0**

#### Current status

The output-isolation and failure-propagation foundation is complete and covered by focused tests.

The authoritative executable characterization gate is **not yet complete**. No real J100 or J50 analysis rerun was performed as part of this activity.

The current tests prove that important failures can be detected and propagated, but they do not yet prove that the complete scientific workflows reproduce the frozen results.

#### Remaining Tier-1 work

Before the executable characterization gate can be accepted:

- Add launcher-level tests proving that a simulated Python analysis failure:
  - produces a nonzero launcher exit status;
  - prevents later plotting commands from running.
- Apply mandatory failure handling to generated binning and BumpHunter execution.
- Decide whether plotting commands are optional diagnostics or required workflow stages.
- Define the complete required-artifact set for fresh J100 and J50 runs.
- Add slow integration tests that:
  - use fresh temporary output directories;
  - execute the actual authoritative J100 and J50 launchers;
  - reject stale or missing outputs;
  - extract results only from newly generated artifacts;
  - compare those results with frozen references.
- Demonstrate that a deliberately perturbed scientific result causes the characterization comparison to fail.
- Run the complete Tier-1 and Tier-2 quality gates after integration.
- Address or explicitly account for the six pre-existing Python `SyntaxWarning` messages if the final acceptance gate requires zero warnings.

#### Scope boundary

This activity did not perform Tier-3 structural refactoring, add orchestration, change the established J100/J50 scientific configuration, or extend the frozen reference to CLs.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain blocked until the test system successfully reruns and validates the authoritative J100/J50 workflows.

- Complete established Tier-1/Tier-2 quality gate:
  - Command: `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
  - Targeted tests: **25 passed in 0.20 seconds**
  - Ruff: **passed**
  - Black: **passed**
  - Warnings: **0**
  - Skipped tests: **0**
  - Full quality-gate exit code: **0**
### 2026-08-20: Tier-1 BumpHunter execution and result-validation hardening

#### Objective

Harden the conditional BumpHunter masking path before running the authoritative J100 and J50 workflows as executable characterization tests.

The goal was to prevent a failed BumpHunter invocation, stale output file, malformed JSON result, or invalid masking interval from reaching the masked-refit stage.

#### Substantial changes completed

- **Made BumpHunter execution mandatory**
  - Updated `python/run_anaFit.py` so the BumpHunter masking-window command uses the established `execute_required()` contract.
  - A nonzero BumpHunter process status now terminates the analysis.
  - A successful process status without the expected `BHresults.json` output also terminates the analysis.

- **Prevented stale BumpHunter output reuse**
  - The analysis now removes a pre-existing `BHresults.json` before starting a new BumpHunter calculation.
  - This prevents a failed invocation from silently reusing results from an earlier analysis run.
  - The masking path requires a newly generated JSON output.

- **Used the BumpHunter environment interpreter directly**
  - Replaced the shell sequence that activated the environment, ran BumpHunter, and then deactivated it.
  - The workflow now invokes `pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3` directly.
  - This ensures the captured return status belongs to `python/FindBHWindow.py` and cannot be hidden by a later shell command.

- **Added validated BumpHunter result loading**
  - Added `load_bumphunter_results()` to `python/run_anaFit.py`.
  - The loader rejects:
    - unreadable result files;
    - malformed JSON;
    - JSON values that are not objects;
    - missing `BlindRange`, `MaskMin`, or `MaskMax` fields;
    - non-integer-compatible mask limits;
    - mask ranges where `MaskMin` is equal to or greater than `MaskMax`;
    - empty or non-string `BlindRange` values.
  - Validated mask limits are converted to integers before the masked refit.
  - Invalid results stop the workflow before masked XML files or masked fit outputs are produced.

- **Confirmed canonical resolution-binning inputs**
  - Verified that both canonical resolution-binning files exist and are tracked:
    - `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/mjjResolutionBinning_481.root`
    - `Input/data/dijetisrTLA/mjjResolutionBinning_344.root`
  - These files are treated as required immutable inputs for the canonical J100 and J50 characterization runs.
  - The canonical tests will not regenerate or modify these tracked inputs.

- **Expanded focused regression coverage**
  - Extended `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` with BumpHunter result-validation tests.
  - Added coverage for:
    - acceptance of a valid BumpHunter payload;
    - rejection of malformed JSON;
    - rejection of missing required fields;
    - rejection of nonnumeric mask limits;
    - rejection of reversed mask limits;
    - rejection of zero-width mask ranges.

#### Verification performed

- Python syntax validation:
  - Command: `python -m py_compile python/run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: exit code **0**

- Existing safety regression suite after BumpHunter execution hardening:
  - Result: **9 passed**

- Formatting of the expanded test file:
  - Command: `python -m black tests/test_run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: **1 file reformatted successfully**

- Ruff validation:
  - Command: `python -m ruff check tests/test_run_anaFit.py`
  - Result: **passed**

- Expanded focused safety and BumpHunter validation suite:
  - Command: `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q`
  - Result: **15 passed in 0.16 seconds**

#### Current status

The BumpHunter command and result-validation logic are now substantially safer and covered by focused tests.

The current tests validate the standalone BumpHunter result loader, but they do not yet exercise the complete conditional BumpHunter branch inside `run_anaFit()`.

No real J100 or J50 analysis rerun was performed as part of this activity.

#### Remaining Tier-1 work

Before attempting the authoritative analysis reruns:

- Add execution-path tests proving that:
  - a stale `BHresults.json` is removed before BumpHunter runs;
  - a BumpHunter process failure terminates the analysis;
  - a successful BumpHunter process without a fresh JSON output terminates the analysis;
  - invalid fresh BumpHunter output prevents the masked refit.
- Run the complete established Tier-1 and Tier-2 quality gate.
- Define the required fresh-output artifacts for J100 and J50.
- Execute both authoritative workflows in clean isolated output directories.
- Extract scientific results only from the fresh outputs.
- Compare the fresh results against the frozen references.
- Demonstrate that a deliberate scientific-result perturbation causes the comparison to fail.

#### Scope boundary

This activity did not change the canonical J100/J50 scientific configuration, enable CLs, perform Tier-3 structural refactoring, or add Tier-4 orchestration.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain blocked until the authoritative executable characterization gate passes.

#### BumpHunter execution-path and complete quality-gate verification

- Expanded focused executable-characterization safety suite:
  - Command: `python -m pytest tests/test_run_anaFit.py -q`
  - Result: **19 passed in 0.18 seconds**
  - Ruff: **passed**
  - Black: **passed**

- Complete established Tier-1/Tier-2 quality gate:
  - Command: `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
  - Targeted tests: **37 passed in 0.23 seconds**
  - Ruff: **passed**
  - Black: **passed**
  - Warnings: **0**
  - Skipped tests: **0**
  - Full quality-gate exit code: **0**

The BumpHunter execution path is now covered for stale-output removal, process failure, missing fresh output, valid output loading, and invalid fresh output rejection.

This result verifies the executable-characterization safety foundation. It does not yet constitute the final Tier-1 executable characterization gate because the tests have not rerun and compared the real J100 and J50 analyses.

### 2026-08-20: Authoritative J100/J50 executable characterization gate passes

#### Objective

Complete the highest-priority Tier-1 safety requirement by proving that the test system reruns the actual authoritative J100 and J50 analysis workflows, validates newly generated artifacts, and compares fresh scientific results against the frozen reference.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Added the explicitly marked slow integration test:
  - `tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py`
- Registered the pytest markers:
  - `integration`
  - `requires_root`
- Kept the slow scientific gate separate from the established fast/full development-quality gate.
- The integration test:
  - executes `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` through Bash;
  - executes `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh` through Bash;
  - redirects both workflows into a fresh pytest temporary output root;
  - requires the expected workspace, fit result, fit parameters, post-fit result, quickFit log, generated configurations, and `analysis_results.json`;
  - requires every scientific artifact to be fresh and nonempty;
  - rejects unexpected masked-fit or BumpHunter outputs;
  - builds the analysis payload exclusively from newly generated outputs;
  - compares the complete fresh J100/J50 payload against the frozen reference.

- Added machine-readable scientific result manifests:
  - `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/analysis_results.json`
  - `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/analysis_results.json`
- Updated the frozen reference with the accepted post-fit chi-square p-values:
  - J100: `0.018448750724012808`
  - J50: `0.07853114301666252`
- Preserved the current background-only scope:
  - no BumpHunter masking was triggered;
  - `p_bh` remains null;
  - `cls_limit_points` remains empty.

#### Executable characterization verification

- Command:

  `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

- Result:
  - **1 passed**
  - Runtime: **175.18 seconds**
  - J100 authoritative workflow: **passed**
  - J50 authoritative workflow: **passed**
  - Fresh artifact validation: **passed**
  - Manifest-backed scientific extraction: **passed**
  - Frozen-reference comparison: **passed**

#### Scientific results protected by the gate

The executable characterization gate now protects:

- J100 background-only fit parameters;
- J50 background-only fit parameters;
- J100 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- J50 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- expected absence of BumpHunter output for the canonical successful unmasked runs;
- expected background-only reference schema;
- expected empty CLs list under the current scope lock;
- freshness and presence of the required scientific artifacts.

#### Current status

The test system now reruns the real authoritative J100 and J50 workflows instead of only rereading committed outputs.

The primary executable-characterization requirement has passed.

Before this Tier-1 slice is closed, remaining verification should prove that a deliberate scientific-result perturbation fails the comparison, rerun the complete established quality gate, and review repository hygiene and final diffs.

#### Known non-blocking findings

- The J100 and J50 launcher files are not executable in the current Git mode and are invoked through Bash by the integration test.
- The post-fit plotting macro attempts to open masked artifacts even when masking was not triggered.
- Those plotting messages do not affect the scientific fit result or executable characterization comparison.
- CLs remains outside the current background-only scope.

#### Scope boundary

No Tier-3 structural refactoring or Tier-4 orchestration was performed.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain blocked until final deliberate-drift verification and complete gate verification are recorded.

#### Final executable-characterization acceptance verification

The Tier-1 executable-characterization safety work received both scientific and development-gate verification.

##### Deliberate scientific-drift detection

A temporary copy of the frozen reference was modified by changing the protected J100 chi-square p-value:

- Original J100 `p_chi2`: `0.018448750724012808`
- Perturbed J100 `p_chi2`: `0.02844875072401281`

The comparison correctly rejected the perturbed reference.

Result:

- Deliberate scientific perturbation: **detected**
- Repository reference modified: **no**
- False acceptance of changed scientific output: **no**

##### Final established Tier-1/Tier-2 quality gate

Command:

`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`

Result:

- Targeted tests collected: **48**
- Targeted tests passed: **48**
- Failed: **0**
- Warnings: **0**
- Skipped: **0**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**
- Full quality-gate exit code: **0**
- Test runtime: **0.36 seconds**

##### Slow executable scientific gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Result:

- Integration tests passed: **1**
- Failed: **0**
- Runtime: **175.18 seconds**
- J100 authoritative workflow rerun: **passed**
- J50 authoritative workflow rerun: **passed**
- Fresh artifact validation: **passed**
- Manifest-backed fit-parameter extraction: **passed**
- Manifest-backed chi-square p-value extraction: **passed**
- Frozen-reference comparison: **passed**

##### Tier-1 acceptance status

The highest-priority executable-characterization requirement is now satisfied.

The test system reruns the actual authoritative J100 and J50 workflows in fresh isolated output directories. It no longer depends only on rereading committed analysis products.

The accepted scientific baseline now protects:

- J100 background-only fit parameters;
- J50 background-only fit parameters;
- J100 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- J50 post-fit chi-square p-value;
- expected unmasked workflow behavior;
- expected absence of BumpHunter output for the canonical runs;
- freshness and presence of required scientific artifacts;
- the current background-only schema with CLs intentionally deferred.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 may remain blocked until the complete change set is reviewed and committed, but the executable characterization gate itself is passing.

#### Final completion status

The previously listed remaining acceptance checks are now complete:

- deliberate scientific-result perturbation was detected successfully;
- the established full quality gate passed with 48 tests, 0 failures, 0 warnings, and 0 skipped;
- Ruff and Black passed;
- the full quality-gate exit code was 0;
- the authoritative executable characterization test passed after rerunning both J100 and J50 from fresh isolated outputs.

The Tier-1 executable characterization gate is complete and passing.

Earlier statements in this activity log describing the gate as incomplete record intermediate project checkpoints and are superseded by this final completion status.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain outside this change set. Any decision to begin Tier 3 should follow review and commit of this completed Tier-1 safety work.
### 2026-08-20: Tier-1 and Tier-2 explicit coverage audit and gate expansion

#### Objective

Audit the original Tier-1 and Tier-2 requirements bullet by bullet and require explicit automated evidence for each completed claim.

This activity expanded the test system beyond basic workflow characterization to cover:

- canonical scientific launcher arguments;
- observable-specific numerical tolerances;
- selected ROOT histogram comparison behavior;
- external dependency revisions;
- scientific runtime readiness;
- generated-output ownership;
- plotting independence;
- launcher permissions;
- clean development-environment reproduction;
- CI quality-gate policy;
- optional pre-commit policy;
- known installation and bootstrap deficiencies;
- initial building blocks for expanded machine-readable provenance.

#### Canonical scientific workflow coverage

The launcher tests now explicitly protect the canonical J100 and J50 analysis contracts.

For J100, the tests verify:

- input file:
  `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J100_dataAll.root`;
- histogram:
  `hists_yStar06_rejectEta_10_16/afterSelection/nominal/h_mjj`;
- fit range:
  `481` to `3000`;
- six-parameter background model;
- prefit enabled;
- mask threshold `0.01`;
- signal fitting disabled;
- limit setting disabled.

For J50, the tests verify:

- input file:
  `Input/data/dijetTLA/mjj_spectra_J50_dataAll.root`;
- histogram:
  `hists_yStar06_massCut/HLT_j0_perf_ds1_L1J50/h_mjj`;
- fit range:
  `344` to `2079`;
- six-parameter background model;
- prefit enabled;
- mask threshold `0.01`;
- signal fitting disabled;
- limit setting disabled.

Verification result:

- canonical launcher contract tests: **2 passed**;
- selected launcher tests deselected: **20**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**.

CLs remains intentionally deferred. The schema continues to require `cls_limit_points`, and both canonical background-only references continue to require an empty list.

#### Observable-specific scientific comparison policy

Added an explicit tolerance-aware comparison policy for analysis references.

Current provisional tolerances:

- fit-parameter relative tolerance: `1e-6`;
- fit-parameter absolute tolerance: `1e-8`;
- p-value relative tolerance: `1e-5`;
- p-value absolute tolerance: `1e-8`.

The comparison keeps exact structural checks for:

- workflow names;
- workflow payload keys;
- fit-parameter names;
- presence versus absence of BumpHunter p-values;
- CLs list structure and contents.

Focused tests prove that:

- identical payloads pass;
- small fit-parameter drift within tolerance passes;
- small p-value drift within tolerance passes;
- excessive fit-parameter drift fails;
- excessive p-value drift fails;
- changed parameter names fail;
- absent versus present BumpHunter results fail;
- changed CLs structure fails.

Verification result:

- explicit tolerance tests: **8 passed**;
- selected tests deselected: **16**.

The authoritative J100/J50 executable characterization test was updated to use the same tolerance-aware comparison policy.

Verification result:

- executable scientific gate: **1 passed**;
- runtime: **185.64 seconds**.

The tolerance values are technically explicit and tested but remain provisional until approved scientifically.

#### ROOT histogram-comparison coverage

Expanded `tests/test_compare_root_outputs.py` from low-level numerical helper coverage to explicit selected-histogram behavior.

The test suite now covers:

- exact numerical equality;
- exact numerical mismatch;
- absolute tolerance;
- relative tolerance;
- NaN handling;
- zero-reference relative differences;
- missing ROOT objects;
- rejection of non-histogram ROOT objects;
- nested ROOT object paths;
- histogram-class mismatches;
- differing bin counts;
- changed bin contents;
- changed bin errors;
- changed bin edges;
- accepted content drift within tolerance.

Verification result:

- ROOT comparator tests: **17 passed**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**.

The accurate capability boundary is that the comparator checks explicitly selected TH1 histogram paths, including nested paths. It does not automatically discover and recursively compare every object in a ROOT file.

#### Plotting separated from scientific acceptance

Added `ANAFIT_SKIP_PLOTS=1` support to both authoritative launchers.

Normal user execution continues to produce plots by default. The scientific integration gate now disables plots explicitly so scientific acceptance depends only on:

- generated configurations;
- workspace output;
- fit result;
- fit-parameter output;
- post-fit ROOT output;
- quickFit log;
- analysis result manifest;
- numerical comparison with the frozen reference.

The required-artifact contract explicitly excludes PDF and other visual outputs.

Verification results:

- successful J100 launcher with plots disabled: **passed**;
- successful J50 launcher with plots disabled: **passed**;
- scientific artifact contract excludes plots: **passed**;
- real no-plot J100/J50 characterization gate: **1 passed**;
- scientific-gate runtime: **163.31 seconds**.

Plotting warnings and missing diagnostic plots can no longer determine scientific acceptance.

#### Authoritative launcher permissions

The documented direct launcher commands previously failed because both scripts were tracked with mode `100644`.

Restored executable permissions for:

- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`;
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J50.sh`.

The integration test now invokes the launchers directly rather than through an explicit Bash command.

Added an automated test requiring both authoritative launchers to have an executable permission bit.

Verification result:

- launcher permission test: **passed**;
- direct-execution J100/J50 integration gate: **1 passed**;
- selected non-integration test: **1 deselected**;
- runtime: **182.97 seconds**.

The executable behavior now matches the commands documented in `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`.

#### Generated-output ownership

Added explicit repository-policy tests to verify that routine generated outputs remain ignored.

The policy tests cover synthetic:

- ROOT files;
- PDF files;
- XML files;
- log files.

The tests also verify that only the two canonical result manifests are re-included:

- `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/analysis_results.json`;
- `run/fits/J50/run_344_2079_sixPar/analysis_results.json`.

Existing generated ROOT, PDF, XML, and log products under the canonical directories were confirmed to be tracked legacy fixtures rather than newly exposed files.

Verification results:

- narrow ignore-policy test: **passed**;
- no unexpected untracked generated products test: **passed**.

#### External dependency revision contract

Added explicit prepared-environment tests for:

- `xmlAnaWSBuilder`;
- `quickFit`;
- `workspaceCombiner`;
- `pyBumpHunter`.

Pinned revisions:

- `xmlAnaWSBuilder`:
  `6b84050f3c0206a6f30eb40b103cc101e68505cc`;
- `quickFit`:
  `0408030b6c8d74a2e2c27a864a02756132d08f5a`;
- `workspaceCombiner`:
  `7d484ad3f89c4075d2c567aa4503fc56e1bb9468`;
- `pyBumpHunter`:
  `91f49a622bd77622edb02a1a2788fc12835e5b72`.

The tests verify:

- every required checkout exists;
- every checkout is readable by Git;
- every checkout matches the pinned revision;
- no checkout contains tracked source modifications.

Untracked build and environment directories such as `cmake/`, `RooFitExtensions/`, and `pyBH_env/` are tolerated.

Verification result:

- prepared dependency tests: **2 passed**.

#### Installation and bootstrap deficiencies

Added explicit tests for the installation contract.

Passing checks:

- `install.sh` records every expected dependency revision;
- `.gitmodules` declares all four expected dependency paths.

Known deficiencies are represented by strict expected-failure tests:

- `.gitmodules` declares dependencies, but the top-level Git index has no corresponding `160000` gitlink entries;
- `install.sh` contains active destructive `rm -rf` operations.

Verification result:

- installation-policy tests passed: **2**;
- strict expected failures: **2**;
- deselected unrelated tests: **9**.

These expected failures keep the known installation deficiencies visible without falsely marking fresh-clone reproducibility as complete.

Fresh-clone dependency acquisition and non-destructive bootstrap behavior remain high-priority Tier-1 work.

#### Scientific runtime readiness

Verified the separation between the development-quality environment and the scientific analysis environment.

Development-quality environment:

- Python `3.12.13`;
- pytest `9.1.1`;
- Ruff `0.16.0`;
- Black `26.5.1`.

Scientific environment selected by `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh`:

- LCG release `LCG_102a`;
- platform `x86_64-centos9-gcc11-opt`;
- Python `3.9.12`;
- ROOT/PyROOT `6.26/08`.

Both `xmlAnaWSBuilder/setup_lxplus.sh` and `quickFit/setup_lxplus.sh` explicitly select the same LCG release.

Added an explicit runtime-readiness test covering:

- successful setup;
- scientific Python version;
- ROOT and PyROOT versions;
- executable XMLReader;
- executable quickFit;
- executable BumpHunter Python environment;
- both canonical J100/J50 data inputs;
- both canonical resolution-binning inputs.

Verification result:

- authoritative scientific-runtime readiness test: **1 passed**.

The earlier ROOT `6.40.02` observation describes the shell before authoritative setup. The actual J100/J50 analyses use ROOT `6.26/08`.

#### Test-gate separation

Registered the pytest marker:

- `requires_analysis_dependencies`.

Applied it only to the two external-checkout tests.

The ordinary fast and full gates now exclude those prepared-environment checks while retaining:

- repository-root checks;
- frozen snapshot checks;
- generated-output ownership checks;
- analysis-reference tests;
- ROOT comparator tests;
- launcher and BumpHunter safety tests.

Verification results:

- lightweight repository tests: **4 passed**, **2 deselected**;
- prepared dependency tests: **2 passed**, **4 deselected**;
- fast quality gate: **58 passed**, **2 deselected**, exit code **0**.

The authoritative gate commands are now separated as follows:

- lightweight development gate:
  `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`;
- prepared dependency gate:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`;
- scientific executable characterization gate:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`.

#### CI policy

Expanded `.github/workflows/tier1-root-comparison.yml` into the Tier-1 and Tier-2 lightweight quality workflow.

The workflow now:

- uses `actions/checkout@v4`;
- uses `actions/setup-python@v5`;
- selects Python `3.12.13`;
- installs `requirements-dev-lock.txt`;
- runs `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`;
- covers `harry` and `tier-2-m365`;
- does not launch the CERN-only integration test;
- does not require prepared external dependency checkouts.

Added an explicit CI policy test.

Verification result:

- CI policy test: **1 passed**.

Local complete lightweight verification after the CI update:

- tests passed: **59**;
- prepared dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**;
- exit code: **0**.

An actual hosted CI run remains pending until the workflow is committed and pushed.

#### Optional pre-commit policy

Documented pre-commit as optional and outside the authoritative Tier-2 acceptance gate.

Current policy:

- `pre-commit` is not installed or pinned;
- contributors are not required to install Git hooks;
- the authoritative quality command is:
  `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`;
- the current Ruff hook version does not match the pinned Tier-2 Ruff version;
- pre-commit remains follow-up work.

Added an explicit policy test.

Verification result:

- optional pre-commit policy test: **1 passed**.

#### Clean dependency-lock reproduction

Created a new temporary Python 3.12 virtual environment outside the repository.

Installed only from `requirements-dev-lock.txt`.

Reproduced versions:

- Python `3.12.13`;
- pytest `9.1.1`;
- Ruff `0.16.0`;
- Black `26.5.1`.

Clean full-gate result:

- tests collected: **62**;
- tests passed: **60**;
- prepared dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**;
- exit code: **0**.

Clean-environment evidence:

- temporary root:
  `/tmp/frequentist-tier2-clean.p2RO1b`;
- full-gate log:
  `/tmp/frequentist-tier2-clean.p2RO1b/full-gate.log`.

The bootstrap upgraded pip to `26.2.1`. Pip itself is not pinned and remains a minor reproducibility follow-up.

#### Initial machine-readable provenance helpers

Added and tested foundational provenance helpers in `python/run_anaFit.py`.

Current helpers cover:

- repository-root discovery from `__file__`;
- deterministic SHA-256 file hashing;
- clear failure for missing files;
- Git revision lookup;
- validation of full 40-character Git revisions;
- clear failure for non-repositories;
- scientific Python version collection;
- scientific Python executable collection;
- active ROOT version collection;
- clear failure when the active ROOT version is unavailable.

Focused verification results:

- repository-root tests: **2 passed**;
- file SHA-256 tests: **2 passed**;
- Git revision tests: **2 passed**;
- scientific runtime collection tests: **2 passed**.

The canonical data and template hashes were also recorded during the audit.

The provenance helpers are tested, but the canonical manifests remain at schema version 1 and do not yet embed full runtime, revision, hash, and invocation provenance.

#### Latest combined gate checkpoint

Latest lightweight full-gate result:

- tests collected: **84**;
- selected tests: **82**;
- tests passed: **80**;
- prepared dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- strict installation-policy expected failures: **2**;

#### Current status

The Tier-1 scientific characterization system is complete and passing for the current background-only J100/J50 scope.

The Tier-2 development-quality environment remains reproducible and passing.

The following items remain incomplete:

- functional Git submodule gitlinks or an equivalent checked-in dependency acquisition manifest;
- non-destructive separation of dependency bootstrap and build operations;
- complete provenance embedded in `analysis_results.json`;
- final provenance-backed regeneration of the J100/J50 manifests;
- actual hosted CI execution after push;
- actual CLs characterization, intentionally deferred;
- scientific approval of the provisional numerical tolerances.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain outside this change set. Tier 3 should not begin until the completed Tier-1/Tier-2 work is reviewed and committed, and the remaining installation-reproducibility risks are explicitly accepted or repaired.

### 2026-08-21: Schema-version-2 scientific provenance completed

#### Objective

Complete machine-readable provenance for the authoritative J100 and J50 background-only executable characterization workflows.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Upgraded `analysis_results.json` from schema version 1 to schema version 2.
- Preserved schema-version-1 reader compatibility for legacy manifests.
- Added strict schema-version-2 provenance validation.
- Added provenance records for:
  - repository commit;
  - active scientific Python version and executable;
  - active ROOT version;
  - `xmlAnaWSBuilder` revision;
  - `quickFit` revision;
  - `workspaceCombiner` revision;
  - `pyBumpHunter` revision;
  - input data path and SHA-256;
  - top-level configuration path and SHA-256;
  - category configuration path and SHA-256;
  - background configuration path and SHA-256;
  - signal configuration path and SHA-256;
  - data histogram;
  - fit-range bounds;
  - signal-enabled state;
  - limit-enabled state;
  - prefit-enabled state;
  - mask threshold.
- Added repository-aware path resolution for relative and absolute scientific inputs.
- Added deterministic file SHA-256 helpers.
- Added Git revision lookup and validation.
- Added scientific runtime collection.
- Connected provenance generation to the successful `run_anaFit()` path.
- Preserved atomic manifest writing.
- Failed analyses still cannot create a misleading success manifest.
- Promoted validated schema-version-2 manifests for both canonical workflows.

#### Canonical scientific manifests

J100:

- schema version: `2`
- status: `success`
- masked: `false`
- `p_chi2`: `0.018448750724012808`

J50:

- schema version: `2`
- status: `success`
- masked: `false`
- `p_chi2`: `0.07853114301666252`

Both canonical manifests pass the production provenance validator and reproduce the frozen scientific reference.

#### Focused verification

- Repository-root helper tests: **2 passed**
- Analysis-path resolution tests: **3 passed**
- File SHA-256 tests: **2 passed**
- File-provenance tests: **3 passed**
- Git revision tests: **2 passed**
- Scientific runtime tests: **2 passed**
- Complete provenance-payload test: **1 passed**
- Provenance-validator tests: **10 passed**
- Schema-version-1 and schema-version-2 manifest tests: **passed**
- Schema-version-2 writer tests: **3 passed**
- Successful unmasked provenance-wiring test: **1 passed**
- Complete `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` suite: **39 passed** before the final wiring test was added
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**

#### Final scientific executable gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Result:

- authoritative J100 rerun: **passed**
- authoritative J50 rerun: **passed**
- fresh schema-version-2 manifest generation: **passed**
- strict provenance validation: **passed**
- fresh artifact validation: **passed**
- tolerance-aware frozen-reference comparison: **passed**
- selected integration tests passed: **1**
- deselected non-integration tests: **2**
- runtime: **116.02 seconds**
- exit code: **0**

#### Current completion status

Machine-readable provenance is complete for the canonical background-only J100 and J50 executable characterization scope.

The executable characterization gate now protects both scientific results and the runtime, dependency, input, configuration, and invocation identity associated with those results.

Remaining known limitations are:

- functional Git submodule gitlinks are still absent;
- `install.sh` remains destructive;
- hosted CI execution remains pending a commit and push;
- CLs characterization remains intentionally deferred;
- numerical tolerances remain provisional pending scientific approval.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 remain outside this change set.

#### Final schema-version-2 verification checkpoint

The complete verification sequence was rerun after promoting the canonical schema-version-2 J100 and J50 manifests.

##### Lightweight full gate

Command:

`python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`

Result:

- tests collected: **105**;
- tests passed: **101**;
- prepared-dependency tests deselected: **2**;
- strict expected installation-policy failures: **2**;
- unexpected failures: **0**;
- Ruff: **passed**;
- Black: **passed**;
- exit code: **0**.

The two strict expected failures continue to document:

- missing Git index gitlinks for the declared external dependencies;
- destructive `rm -rf` operations in `install.sh`.

##### Prepared-dependency gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`

Result:

- tests passed: **2**;
- tests deselected: **11**;
- failures: **0**;
- exit code: **0**.

The prepared `xmlAnaWSBuilder`, `quickFit`, `workspaceCombiner`, and `pyBumpHunter` checkouts remain at their pinned revisions and contain no tracked source modifications.

##### Scientific executable gate

Command:

`python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Result:

- tests passed: **1**;
- tests deselected: **2**;
- failures: **0**;
- runtime: **116.02 seconds**;
- exit code: **0**.

The scientific gate successfully:

- reran J100 and J50 from fresh isolated outputs;
- generated fresh schema-version-2 manifests;
- validated complete runtime, dependency, input, configuration, and invocation provenance;
- validated required fresh scientific artifacts;
- reproduced the frozen fit parameters and chi-square p-values within the approved provisional comparison policy;
- remained on the expected unmasked background-only path;
- excluded diagnostic plotting from scientific acceptance.

##### Final status

Machine-readable provenance is complete and passing for the canonical J100 and J50 background-only executable characterization scope.

The remaining known Tier-1 limitations are dependency acquisition and installer safety. These are represented by strict expected-failure tests and must not be described as complete.

Hosted CI execution remains pending commit and push. CLs characterization remains intentionally deferred. Numerical tolerances remain provisional pending scientific approval.

#### Tier-1 and Tier-2 operating documentation synchronized

Updated the user-facing system documentation to match the final verified implementation:

- `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`
- `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md`
- `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`

The documents now record:

- schema-version-2 J100 and J50 manifests;
- complete machine-readable scientific provenance;
- canonical numerical chi-square p-values;
- explicit fit-parameter and p-value tolerances;
- the current lightweight, prepared-dependency, runtime-readiness, and scientific gates;
- the Python 3.12.13 development environment;
- the Python 3.9.12 and ROOT 6.26/08 scientific environment;
- plotting independence and executable launcher permissions;
- CI and optional pre-commit policies;
- missing Git submodule gitlinks and destructive installer behavior as known limitations.

Obsolete descriptions of null canonical chi-square p-values, the historical 18-test baseline, unavailable Ruff and Black tooling, and Python 3.9.25 as the active quality environment were removed.

Verification:

- all three documents retain their established repository names;
- no `UPDATED_*` files remain under `doc/`;
- documentation-specific `git diff --check` passed;
- complete repository `git diff --check` passed.

### 2026-08-21: Hosted CI policy-test hardening and Node.js 24 action update

#### Objective

Correct the hosted lightweight quality-gate failure caused by brittle exact-text assertions against human-readable Tier-2 documentation, and update the GitHub Actions dependencies to Node.js 24-compatible releases.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Removed exact prose assertions against `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` from `tests/test_repo_utils.py`.
- Replaced the documentation-wording test with a machine-verifiable policy test confirming that pre-commit is absent from both development dependency manifests.
- Preserved the policy that pre-commit is optional and outside the authoritative Tier-2 acceptance environment.
- Updated the CI policy test so supported GitHub Action versions can be upgraded without requiring obsolete exact versions.
- Updated the hosted workflow:
  - `actions/checkout@v4` to `actions/checkout@v6`;
  - `actions/setup-python@v5` to `actions/setup-python@v6`.
- Kept the hosted workflow limited to the locked lightweight quality gate.
- Made no changes to scientific analysis code, frozen references, provenance records, or J100/J50 workflow contracts.

#### Verification performed

Focused policy tests:

- `test_ci_runs_locked_lightweight_full_gate`: passed
- `test_precommit_is_not_a_locked_development_dependency`: passed
- Result: **2 passed**

Formatting and linting:

- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**

Complete lightweight quality gate:

- tests collected: **105**
- tests passed: **101**
- prepared-dependency tests deselected: **2**
- strict expected installation-policy failures: **2**
- unexpected failures: **0**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**

#### Current status

The local lightweight gate passes after removing the brittle Markdown prose assertions and updating the GitHub Actions versions.

The two strict expected failures continue to represent:

- missing Git submodule gitlinks;
- destructive `rm -rf` operations in `install.sh`.

The updated workflow must be committed and pushed so the corrected hosted GitHub Actions result can be verified.

#### Scope boundary

This change affects only lightweight repository-policy testing and hosted CI dependencies. It does not change the background-only scientific analysis, the authoritative J100/J50 workflows, numerical references, scientific provenance, or the accepted no-signal scope.

### 2026-08-21: External dependency Git gitlinks repaired

#### Objective

Repair the missing Git index gitlinks for the four declared scientific dependencies so that the parent repository records their verified pinned revisions.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Aligned the dependency URLs in `.gitmodules` with the repositories used by `install.sh` and the verified prepared checkouts:
  - `xmlAnaWSBuilder`: `https://github.com/tofitsch/xmlAnaWSBuilder.git`
  - `quickFit`: `https://github.com/tofitsch/quickFit.git`
  - `workspaceCombiner`: `https://github.com/tofitsch/workspaceCombiner.git`
  - `pyBumpHunter`: `https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyBumpHunter.git`
- Added mode-`160000` Git index gitlinks for:
  - `xmlAnaWSBuilder` at `6b84050f3c0206a6f30eb40b103cc101e68505cc`
  - `quickFit` at `0408030b6c8d74a2e2c27a864a02756132d08f5a`
  - `workspaceCombiner` at `7d484ad3f89c4075d2c567aa4503fc56e1bb9468`
  - `pyBumpHunter` at `91f49a622bd77622edb02a1a2788fc12835e5b72`
- Added `ignore = untracked` for `workspaceCombiner` so local build products do not make the parent repository appear dirty.
- Removed the obsolete strict `xfail` marker from the gitlink policy test.
- Preserved the gitlink test as a normal required passing test.
- Updated the current Tier-1, Tier-2, and environment-provenance documentation.
- Preserved historical activity-log statements describing the previously missing gitlinks.
- Made no changes to dependency source files, scientific results, frozen references, or the authoritative J100/J50 workflow contracts.

#### Verification performed

Gitlink policy test:

- `test_declared_submodules_have_gitlink_entries`: **passed**

Complete repository utility suite:

- tests passed: **12**
- strict expected failures: **1**
- unexpected failures: **0**

Prepared-dependency gate:

- tests passed: **2**
- tests deselected: **11**
- failures: **0**
- exit code: **0**

Complete lightweight quality gate:

- tests collected: **105**
- tests passed: **102**
- prepared-dependency tests deselected: **2**
- strict expected installation-policy failures: **1**
- unexpected failures: **0**
- Ruff: **passed**
- Black: **passed**
- exit code: **0**

Repository validation:

- all four dependency entries use Git index mode `160000`;
- all four entries record the verified pinned revisions;
- all prepared checkouts contain no tracked source modifications;
- `git diff --check` passed.

#### Current status

The missing Git submodule gitlinks limitation is resolved.

The remaining strict expected installation-policy failure documents the destructive `rm -rf` operations in `install.sh`.

Clean-clone scientific dependency acquisition has not yet been verified end to end. The existing prepared LXPlus scientific environment remains verified and unchanged.

#### Scope boundary

This change repairs dependency metadata and repository policy only. It does not modify the background-only scientific analysis, the authoritative J100/J50 workflows, numerical references, schema-version-2 provenance, or the accepted no-signal scope.

### 2026-08-21: Non-destructive installer validation checkpoint

#### Objective

Replace the destructive installer with a verified read-only installation contract and harden the dedicated pyBumpHunter installer.

#### Substantial changes completed

- Removed destructive deletion, direct cloning, pulling, and checkout operations from `install.sh`.
- Made `install.sh` executable and added a read-only `--check` mode.
- Added checks for dependency gitlinks, checked-out revisions, tracked source changes, nested RooFitExtensions revisions, and required files.
- Replaced the pyBumpHunter installer with a non-destructive LCG 102a implementation.
- The pyBumpHunter installer preserves a valid environment and refuses to overwrite an invalid environment.
- Removed unpinned package upgrades, the external virtualenv dependency, LCG 105, and deprecated setup.py installation.
- Added machine-verifiable installer policy tests.
- Removed the obsolete test requiring dependency revisions to be duplicated inside `install.sh`.
- Updated the current Tier-1, Tier-2, and environment-provenance documentation.

#### Verification performed

- `bash install.sh --check`: passed and preserved the repository state.
- pyBumpHunter isolated installation and import test: passed.
- Existing pyBumpHunter environment preservation check: passed.
- Repository utility suite: 13 passed.
- Prepared-dependency gate: 2 passed and 11 deselected.
- Full lightweight gate: 103 passed and 2 deselected.
- Expected failures: 0.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- Shell syntax checks: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

#### Current status

The destructive installer behavior is resolved. The repository now has a verified read-only installation check and a non-destructive pyBumpHunter installer.

A complete non-destructive C++ dependency build mode is not yet enabled. Clean-clone acquisition and building remain to be verified end to end.

#### Scope boundary

This checkpoint changes dependency validation and installation safety only. It does not modify the J100 or J50 scientific workflows, scientific results, frozen references, provenance, or the background-only analysis scope.

### 2026-08-21: Non-destructive dependency build mode completed

#### Objective

Complete and verify the non-destructive dependency build mode for the prepared scientific environment.

#### Changes completed

- Added `install.sh --build`.
- The build runs the read-only dependency contract before compilation.
- Added strict positive-integer validation for `INSTALL_JOBS`.
- Reused existing build directories without deleting them.
- Rebuilt the three pinned RooFitExtensions checkouts.
- Rebuilt xmlAnaWSBuilder, quickFit, and workspaceCombiner.
- Validated XMLReader, quickFit, workspaceCombiner manager, and their required libraries.
- Copied only the required RooFitExtensions products into each parent dependency.
- Avoided `cmake --install` for RooFitExtensions and avoided writes to `/usr/local`.
- Preserved failed build directories for inspection.
- Validated the existing pyBumpHunter environment through the safe installer.
- Updated installer policy tests and removed obsolete build-pending assertions.
- Updated the Tier-1, Tier-2, and environment-provenance documentation.

#### Isolated build verification

- RooFitExtensions and xmlAnaWSBuilder: passed.
- RooFitExtensions and quickFit: passed.
- RooFitExtensions and workspaceCombiner: passed.
- All isolated build directories were removed after testing.
- No tracked dependency source modifications were introduced.

#### Prepared-checkout build verification

- Command: `INSTALL_JOBS=2 bash install.sh --build`.
- Build exit code: 0.
- All three RooFitExtensions copies built successfully.
- xmlAnaWSBuilder, quickFit, and workspaceCombiner built successfully.
- The pyBumpHunter environment validated successfully.
- All 12 protected C++ build artifacts remained present.
- All 12 post-build SHA-256 hashes matched the pre-build baseline exactly.
- Only generated artifact timestamps changed.
- No tracked source modifications were introduced in any dependency.

#### Post-build verification

- Runtime readiness: 1 passed, 2 deselected in 16.39 seconds.
- Authoritative J100/J50 scientific gate: 1 passed, 2 deselected in 152.86 seconds.
- Lightweight gate: 103 passed, 2 deselected.
- Expected failures: 0.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- All relevant exit codes: 0.

#### Current status

The prepared-checkout non-destructive dependency build mode is operational and scientifically verified.

Clean-clone submodule acquisition and building have not yet been verified end to end in a separate fresh checkout.

#### Scope boundary

This change affects installation and dependency build safety only. It does not change the J100 or J50 background-only scientific workflows, frozen references, numerical results, or schema-version-2 provenance.

### 2026-08-21: Redundant modular tier-check framework retired

#### Objective

Audit the experimental `tier_checks/` framework against the completed authoritative Tier-1 and Tier-2 system, remove it if it provided no unique acceptance coverage, and preserve the existing activity-log history unchanged.

#### Coverage audit completed

Every framework component and all 12 modular checks were reviewed against the authoritative tests and operating gates.

The audit found no unique accepted scientific, dependency, repository, installer, build, runtime, or CI protection in `tier_checks/`.

The framework had fallen behind the authoritative system:

- its targeted pytest check omitted `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`;
- its Ruff and Black target list also omitted `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`;
- its Ruff and Black checks targeted the complete `tier_checks/` directory rather than an explicit Python-file list;
- its workflow-input check was weaker than the accepted launcher-contract tests;
- its recorded-output check verified existing non-empty logs rather than fresh scientific execution;
- its reference contract was weaker than the production schema-version-2 provenance validator;
- its full-quality check directly invoked the authoritative `scripts/quality_check.py` gate;
- its in-depth mode duplicated pytest, Ruff, and Black execution;
- warnings and skipped checks counted as successful outcomes.

#### Removal completed

- Removed all 27 tracked files under `tier_checks/`.
- Removed ignored Python bytecode caches left under the retired directory.
- Confirmed that the `tier_checks/` directory no longer exists.
- Updated `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` to record the retirement and identify the authoritative replacement gates.
- Corrected the optional pre-commit wording to refer to the authoritative lightweight quality gate.
- Preserved every existing activity-log entry unchanged.

#### Useful ideas retained for possible future work

- per-command subprocess timeouts;
- optional provenance-backed JSON quality reports;
- requirement-level duration reporting;
- concise failure-output summaries;
- active Python executable and version reporting;
- active tool-version verification derived from the dependency lock;
- non-empty presence checks for authoritative documentation.

These are optional enhancements to the authoritative system and do not require maintaining a second acceptance framework.

#### Verification performed

- Full lightweight gate: 103 passed and 2 prepared-dependency tests deselected.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- Full lightweight gate exit code: 0.
- Prepared-dependency gate: 2 passed and 11 deselected.
- Prepared-dependency gate exit code: 0.
- Repository diff validation: passed.

#### Current status

The repository now has one authoritative Tier-1 and Tier-2 acceptance system rather than two divergent implementations.

The authoritative interfaces remain the lightweight full gate, prepared-dependency gate, runtime-readiness gate, J100/J50 scientific integration gate, installer check mode, and non-destructive dependency build mode.

#### Scope boundary

This change removes redundant experimental checking infrastructure only. It does not modify the authoritative J100 or J50 workflows, scientific results, frozen references, schema-version-2 provenance, dependency revisions, installer behaviour, or accepted background-only analysis scope.

#### 2026-08-27: Copilot merge-review safety corrections

##### Objective

Resolve the ten findings reported by GitHub Copilot during review of pull request 5 before merging the Tier-1 and Tier-2 branch.

##### Changes completed

- Updated mandatory command execution to remove expected outputs before execution, preventing stale XMLReader or quickFit artifacts from satisfying a successful command.
- Added explicit rejection of non-finite values in tolerance-aware scientific comparisons.
- Updated Git provenance collection to reject repositories with staged or unstaged tracked modifications while permitting untracked build products.
- Aligned schema-version-2 production and validation for optional background and signal configuration files by recording absent values as null.
- Preserved validated stable provenance in analysis-reference payloads.
- Added exact comparison of runtime identity, dependency revisions, input identity, configuration identity, and invocation settings.
- Kept repository_commit in full manifests while excluding it from the frozen reference to avoid a self-referential commit cycle.
- Updated quickLimit failure handling so a failed requested limit returns a nonzero status before provenance or success-manifest generation.
- Updated run_injections_anaFit.py to return the run_anaFit status.
- Updated the pyBumpHunter installer to reject an existing environment whose Python version differs from the authoritative scientific Python version.
- Updated the frozen J100 and J50 reference with stable provenance.
- Added focused regression coverage for stale outputs, non-finite values, provenance drift, dirty repositories, quickLimit failure, injection-runner status propagation, nullable configuration provenance, and pyBumpHunter interpreter-version policy.

##### Verification performed

Focused Python suites:

- 105 tests passed.
- Failures: 0.

Authoritative lightweight gate:

- Tests collected: 122.
- Tests passed: 120.
- Prepared-dependency tests deselected: 2.
- Ruff: passed.
- Black: passed.
- Unexpected failures: 0.

Repository validation:

- git diff --check passed.
- Broad legacy formatting changes introduced during review were removed before final verification.
- The resulting change set remains limited to the reviewed safety corrections and their tests.

##### Remaining work

- Commit the reviewed safety corrections.
- Regenerate the canonical J100 and J50 schema-version-2 manifests from the resulting clean committed tree.
- Verify that each regenerated manifest records the new commit.
- Rerun the prepared-dependency, runtime-readiness, scientific characterization, and lightweight gates.
- Resolve the remaining upstream merge conflicts.

#### 2026-08-27: Canonical manifest provenance corrected

##### Objective

Complete the remaining GitHub Copilot review findings by regenerating the canonical J100 and J50 schema-version-2 manifests from a clean committed source revision.

##### Changes completed

- Moved provenance collection to the beginning of run_anaFit(), before generated outputs can modify tracked repository artifacts.
- Retained success-manifest writing at the end of the workflow so failed analyses cannot record success.
- Committed the provenance-ordering correction as:
  - 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556
  - Capture provenance before analysis output generation
- Confirmed the repository was clean before scientific execution.
- Regenerated J100 and J50 in a temporary output root.
- Copied only the regenerated analysis_results.json manifests into the canonical tracked locations.
- Preserved all other tracked scientific artifacts unchanged.

##### Scientific regeneration results

J100:

- Global chi-square p-value: 0.018448750724012808.
- Workflow completed successfully.
- Manifest repository commit:
  - 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556

J50:

- Global chi-square p-value: 0.07853114301666252.
- Workflow completed successfully.
- Manifest repository commit:
  - 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556

##### Verification performed

- Both workflows completed successfully from temporary isolated outputs.
- Both regenerated manifests record the clean source revision used for execution.
- Only the two canonical analysis_results.json files were promoted.
- The canonical reference validation test passed:
  - 1 passed.
  - 43 deselected.
  - Failures: 0.

##### Review status

All ten GitHub Copilot review findings are now resolved at the implementation and canonical-evidence level. The two inaccurate manifest-revision findings are resolved by scientifically regenerating both canonical manifests from clean commit 132a8b35e9e3a4042fe55a452c5806514cac8556.

##### Remaining verification

- Rerun the prepared-dependency gate.
- Rerun scientific runtime readiness.
- Rerun the authoritative J100/J50 scientific characterization gate.
- Rerun the authoritative lightweight gate.
- Commit the regenerated manifests and this evidence entry.
- Resolve the upstream merge conflicts.

#### 2026-08-27: Copilot review corrections final verification

##### Final verification

Prepared-dependency gate:

- 2 passed.
