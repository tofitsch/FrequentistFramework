# Tier 3 Completion Plan

## 0. What this document is

This document is the **authoritative execution plan** for Tier 3 —
structural refactoring of the authoritative J100/J50 analysis pipeline —
on the `tier-3-claude` branch of this repository.

It covers the **complete pipeline invoked by the launcher scripts**, from
`scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`/`run_anaFit_J50.sh` through to the production
of diagnostic plots: `python/run_anaFit.py` (the coordinator being split
into modules, Chunks 1–8), `plot_edm.py` (Chunk 9), `python/plotPostFit.py`
(Chunk 10), and `plot_postfit.cpp` (Chunk 11). Chunks 0–12 covered exactly
these four files — see Section 3 as it stood at Chunk 12's completion.

**Scope extended 2026-09-04** (Chunks 13–18): `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`
traced a real `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` run end to end and found five
more files sitting directly on that same hot path that Chunks 0–12
deliberately left untouched: `python/PreFit.py`,
`python/ExtractFitParameters.py`, `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`,
`python/createBinning.py`, `python/FindBHWindow.py`. Chunks 13–18 bring
these five into the same system, using this document's own established
Step A/Step B methodology unchanged. Section 3's in/out-of-scope lists
below describe the current, extended scope — not the original four-file
scope Chunks 0–12 executed against.

It is written from a from-scratch analysis of this branch's own state and
was **not** written by consulting, importing, or adapting any other
branch's Tier 3 design, audit findings, module boundaries, or prose. Other
branches or forks of this repository may contain independent Tier 3
attempts with different module names or extraction choices; that is
expected and is not evidence that this plan is wrong or needs to match
them. Do not open, diff against, or otherwise consult another branch's
Tier 3 artifacts while executing this plan.

**Delivery model**: this plan is delivered as a sequence of small,
individually-verifiable steps (Step A, then Step B, per chunk — see
Section 5), each recorded as its own commit with its own activity-log
entry, so the work is reviewable at that granularity regardless of how it
is eventually batched into pull requests for review. Section 5 defines
the two-step pattern every chunk follows, the required human-verification
checkpoint between steps, and the templates/checklists used to decide
whether a step (or the PR that eventually bundles one or more chunks) is
ready. Section 6 breaks the work into chunks and applies that pattern to
each. **Read Section 5 before starting any chunk** — it defines the
review contract every chunk depends on.

If you are an LLM or engineer picking up Tier 3 work, **read this document
in full before touching any file**, then follow it exactly. It is written
to be followed mechanically, item by item, with no scope judgment calls
left open, and to be reviewable one small step at a time.

### Document hierarchy (who wins when documents disagree)

1. **This document** — the current Tier 3 backlog, step structure, and
   guardrails.
2. `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`, `doc/TIER1_ENVIRONMENT_PROVENANCE.md`,
   `doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` — non-negotiable scientific, environment, and
   development-quality contracts established before Tier 3 began. Nothing
   in Tier 3 work may weaken these.
3. `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` — the chronological evidence record. Authoritative
   for **what has actually happened**, in date order. Never authoritative
   for what *should* happen next — that is this document's job. Every
   step's commit appends one new entry here (Section 5's templates double
   as the activity-log entry — see Section 5).
4. `Claude science raw output.md` (repository root) — informal background
   material that originally proposed the Tier 1–4 structure, including the
   description of Tier 3 as "assisted structural refactoring" using an
   IDE's extract-function and rename-symbol tooling, and Tier 1's
   "characterization ('golden-master') tests... freeze the outputs...
   assert every future run reproduces them" guidance, which is exactly the
   methodology Section 5 applies at the level of individual functions
   rather than the whole pipeline. Non-authoritative context only; do not
   cite it as justification for a scope decision.

If any instruction below conflicts with a Tier 1 or Tier 2 contract, the
Tier 1/2 contract wins and the conflict must be raised rather than
silently resolved.

---

## 1. Non-negotiable guardrails

These apply to every single change made under this plan, no exceptions.

1. **No scientific change.** Frozen references
   (`tests/references/analysis_reference.json`), tolerances, fit
   configuration, canonical inputs, histogram paths, fit ranges, dependency
   revisions, and the schema-version-2 manifest contract must not change as
   a side effect of refactoring. The Tier 1 gates (Section 7) are the proof
   that a change did not move the science — not an assertion in prose.
2. **The activity log is append-only.**
   - Every step's commit adds a **new dated, titled section** at the end
     of `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`, using Section 5's activity-log-entry
     templates.
   - **Never** edit, reorder, shorten, or delete an existing section. If
     later work contradicts or supersedes an earlier statement, write a
     new entry that says so explicitly. The old entry stays exactly as
     written.
   - Results are **only ever added**, never removed: do not delete old
     verification output, old test counts, or old known-limitations text
     to make the log read more cleanly.
3. **Tests before code — structurally enforced by the two-step pattern.**
   No production file targeted by a chunk may be modified until the
   characterization tests for that chunk's target function(s) have been
   (a) written against the **current, unmodified** code, in their own
   commit that touches no production file, and (b) reviewed and explicitly
   confirmed by a human, in session, to pass and to faithfully capture real
   behavior (not just "does not raise"). See Section 5, "Every chunk is
   delivered as two ordered steps." Making Step B's commit before Step A's
   human-verification checkpoint has happened is out of process and must
   not be done.
4. **Every function created or materially modified requires new, focused
   tests**, covering: its normal successful path; at least one meaningful
   invalid-input or failure path (where applicable); its return value and
   any externally visible side effect. Moving a function is not exempt —
   its existing tests move with it (Section 5's Test Relocation Rule) and
   any newly-introduced function gets new tests under guardrail 3.
5. **No broad automated cleanup.** Never run
   `python -m ruff check .`, `python -m black .`, `python -m black --check .`,
   or an equivalent whole-repository formatting pass over `.cpp` files.
   Use `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`, and add every new
   source and test file to its explicit `python_targets`/`test_targets`
   lists as part of the same commit that creates the file.
6. **Explicit git staging only.** No `git add .`, no `git commit -a`. Stage
   only the paths that belong to the change being made.
7. **One commit = one step of one chunk; Step A always precedes Step B in
   the commit history.** Never combine a characterization step and an
   extraction step in the same commit. The human-verification checkpoint
   (Section 5) happens between them, in session, before Step B's commit is
   made — this is what a reviewer (human or automated) checks by reading
   the commit history in order, since individual steps are not each their
   own separately-merged GitHub pull request (Section 5, "What actually
   gets reviewed on GitHub"). A PR opened for review may bundle one chunk
   or a small, clearly-labeled batch of chunks/standalone fixes, but must
   never obscure the Step A/Step B ordering within its own commit history.
8. **Every change must be checked against this document** before its
   commit is made. Section 8 gives the exact checklist. If any answer is
   "no," the change is not ready.
9. **Do not describe a chunk as complete in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` or in an
   activity-log entry unless the corresponding tests and gates have
   actually been run and have actually passed**, with output captured in
   the same entry.
10. **Do not consult another branch's Tier 3 work while executing this
    plan.** If you discover another branch already contains Tier 3 work,
    do not open it, diff it, or use it as a reference — finish this plan's
    chunks from this document alone, and flag the discovery to the user.
11. **Prefer relocating or reusing an existing import/function over
    writing new logic.** A module-level `import` may be moved to
    function-local scope where it reduces a new module's test dependencies
    (Section 4's import-placement table) — that is a reorganization of an
    existing statement, not new code. No chunk may add an import of
    anything not already imported somewhere in the target file today, and
    no chunk may add a runtime dependency not already present in
    `requirements-dev-lock.txt` or the existing CVMFS/LCG scientific
    environment (Python chunks), or a new external library beyond what
    `plot_postfit.cpp`/ROOT already links today (C++ chunk). This
    refactor's purpose is readability and changeability of existing code,
    not new capability.

---

## 2. Verified current state (baseline for this plan)

This baseline was directly re-confirmed by reading the actual files on
this branch (2026-09-02), at commit `5cb6a32` (`tier-3-claude`):

- `python/run_anaFit.py` is **901 lines**, a single module mixing command
  execution, BumpHunter integration, provenance collection, manifest
  writing, XML templating, fit execution, coordination, and CLI parsing
  (full function inventory in Section 4).
- `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh` (and the J50 equivalent), after a
  successful `run_anaFit.py` invocation and unless `ANAFIT_SKIP_PLOTS=1`,
  runs two more plotting steps in sequence:
  ```bash
  python "$repo_dir/python/plotPostFit.py" -i "${folder}/PostFit_anaFit_${pars}Par_bkgOnly.root" -o "${folder}/postFit.pdf"
  root -l -q "plot_postfit.cpp(\"$folder\", \"$pars\")"
  ```
  `python/run_anaFit.py`'s own `build_fit_extract()` (moving to `run_fit.py`
  under Chunk 6) additionally shells out to `plot_edm.py` (repository
  root) after every quickFit invocation: `execute("python plot_edm.py %s
  %s" % (logfile, edmplot))`. These three files — `plot_edm.py`,
  `python/plotPostFit.py`, `plot_postfit.cpp` — are the "production of the
  plots" this plan's scope extends to.
- `plot_edm.py` (76 lines, repository root) has **one** function,
  `plot_minuit_continuous(filename, outname)`, which parses a quickFit log
  for Minuit convergence trace lines, then builds and saves a matplotlib
  figure — two responsibilities in one function, plus a `__main__` CLI
  wrapper.
- `python/plotPostFit.py` (79 lines) has **zero functions** — the entire
  file is top-level script code (argparse → open ROOT file → style
  histograms → build a ratio plot → draw a two-pad canvas → save). This is
  the starkest case in this plan of code that needs splitting into
  functions to be readable or independently testable at all.
- `plot_postfit.cpp` (288 lines, repository root, a ROOT macro invoked via
  `root -l -q`) has **one** function, `plot_postfit(char const* in_dir,
  char const* pars_str)`, doing: file-path construction and opening;
  histogram retrieval with null checks; BumpHunter JSON parsing via an
  inline regex lambda; chi²/p-value/nbkg extraction; and a three-panel
  plotting loop with per-panel styling and label text. No existing test
  harness covers ROOT macros in this repository — `test.cpp`,
  `scripts/test2.cpp`, `scripts/test3.cpp` are ad hoc scratch/debug scripts
  referencing hardcoded EOS paths, not a reusable test pattern; Chunk 11
  introduces the first one.
- Fixture data already committed and usable for characterization,
  confirmed present under `run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/`:
  `PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`, `FitParameters_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`,
  `quickFitLog_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.log`, `analysis_results.json`. No
  `BHresults.json` is present for this canonical run (background-only,
  unmasked — consistent with the established Tier 1 baseline), so
  characterization of `plot_postfit.cpp`/`plotPostFit.py` against this
  fixture exercises the no-BumpHunter path; that is expected and correct,
  not a gap to fix.
- `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` on this branch records complete, verified Tier 1
  and Tier 2 history ending 2026-09-01 (merge of `github-actions-analysis`
  into `tier-2-m365`) and **contains no Tier 3 entries** — Tier 3 has not
  previously been started on this branch.
- No `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` exists yet; Chunk 12 creates it.
- `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` (1,399 lines, 39 test functions) already
  covers most of `run_anaFit.py`'s current functions — see Chunk-by-chunk
  Test Relocation Rule application in Section 6. `plot_edm.py`,
  `plotPostFit.py`, and `plot_postfit.cpp` have **no existing tests at
  all** — every test for them, at both the characterization and
  extraction stage, is new.
- `scripts/quality_check.py` maintains explicit `python_targets`/
  `test_targets` lists; `python/run_anaFit.py` and `plot_edm.py`/
  `python/plotPostFit.py` are currently **absent** from `python_targets`
  (not ruff/black-checked today).
- The established gates (all currently passing per the 2026-09-01
  activity-log entry):
  - `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v`
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v`

Treat this section as ground truth for "what exists before Tier 3 starts."
If a later chunk's own re-check finds this section inaccurate, record the
correction in a new activity-log entry rather than editing this section.

## 3. Scope of Tier 3

### In scope

- Splitting `python/run_anaFit.py` into focused, single-responsibility
  modules (Chunks 1–8), with `run_anaFit.py` reduced to a thin coordinator
  plus CLI entry point.
- Splitting `plot_edm.py` into a parse function and a plot function
  (Chunk 9).
- Splitting `python/plotPostFit.py` from zero functions into a set of
  named functions plus a `main()` (Chunk 10).
- Splitting `plot_postfit.cpp`'s single function into smaller free
  functions with a stable public entry point (Chunk 11).
- Writing characterization tests against each target's **unmodified**
  behavior first, human-verified and merged, before any extraction
  (Section 5).
- Adding the new tests guardrail 4 requires for any newly-introduced
  function.
- Registering every new source and test file in `scripts/quality_check.py`.
- Creating `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` (Chunk 12).
- **(Chunks 13–18, added 2026-09-04)** Decomposing the five additional
  hot-path support files identified by `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`:
  `python/createBinning.py` (Chunk 13), `python/FindBHWindow.py`
  (Chunk 14), `python/ExtractFitParameters.py` (Chunk 15),
  `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` (Chunk 16, plus two optional,
  separately-scoped bug-fix chunks 16a/16b), `python/PreFit.py`
  (Chunk 17), each with the same characterization-first Step A/Step B
  model, new tests, and `scripts/quality_check.py` registration as
  Chunks 1–11; and revising this document's and `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s/
  `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`'s scope-closure language to reflect the
  larger scope (Chunk 18).

### Out of scope

- CLs processing, signal-analysis changes, different fit models, inputs,
  histograms, ranges, or tolerances.
- Tier 4 orchestration (Hamilton, Snakemake, or any DAG/workflow engine).
- Repository-wide Ruff/Black formatting, or any repository-wide C++
  reformatting.
- Unrelated installer, CI, or dependency changes.
- Any structural extraction of files other than the nine named across
  Section 0 and the Chunk 13–18 addition above — not
  `python/analysis_reference.py`, `python/repo_utils.py`,
  `python/run_injections_anaFit.py`'s own internals, nor any other script
  under `python/` (signal injection, limit-setting, toy studies, and the
  ~40 other scripts there remain untouched — they are not part of the
  background-only J100/J50 canonical path this plan follows, per
  `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`'s own trace of that path).
- Fixing `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`'s two dormant bugs (Chunk 16's
  own text) anywhere other than the two dedicated, explicitly-optional
  bug-fix chunks 16a/16b — never silently bundled into Chunk 16's own
  extraction commit.
- Changing the ROOT/C++ build system, adding a new C++ test framework, or
  introducing any C++ library beyond what `plot_postfit.cpp` already links
  (ROOT itself and the repository's existing `atlasstyle-00-04-02` macros).
- Fixing pre-existing, unrelated issues noticed along the way (e.g. the six
  legacy invalid-escape-sequence `SyntaxWarning` messages) — note them in
  the activity log if seen again, do not fix them unless a chunk says to.

---

## 4. Target architecture

### 4.1 `python/run_anaFit.py` → 7 modules + coordinator

| New module | Responsibility | Functions moving from `run_anaFit.py` |
|---|---|---|
| `run_execution.py` | Generic subprocess execution and the "command succeeded and produced its required outputs" contract. No ROOT dependency. | `execute`, `execute_required` |
| `run_manifest.py` | Writing the schema-version-2 `analysis_results.json` manifest atomically. | `write_analysis_results` |
| `run_provenance.py` | Repository/path resolution, file hashing, Git revision lookup, scientific runtime collection, and assembling the full provenance payload. | `get_repository_root`, `resolve_analysis_path`, `calculate_file_sha256`, `build_file_provenance`, `get_git_revision`, `collect_scientific_runtime`, `build_analysis_provenance` |
| `run_masking.py` | BumpHunter invocation and result validation, plus a single shared masking-decision predicate. | `load_bumphunter_results`, `run_bumphunter`, and a **new** `should_mask(p_value, threshold)` helper (Chunk 4) |
| `run_templates.py` | Materializing the per-run XML templates (top/category/signal/background files), including the prefit-driven parameter-range substitution. Named for what it produces — XML *template* files, not the RooFit `.root` workspace (built later, in `run_fit.py`). | `replaceinfile`, plus the template-copy/substitute/prefit block currently inlined in `run_anaFit()` |
| `run_fit.py` | Running XMLReader + quickFit and extracting post-fit/parameter outputs for one fit invocation (masked or unmasked). | `build_fit_extract` |
| `run_cli.py` | Argument parsing and signal-name normalization for the command-line entry point. | `main`'s argparse setup and the signal-name default logic currently inlined in `main()` |

`run_anaFit.py` keeps only `run_anaFit()`, a thin `main(args)`, and the
`if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. No extracted module may import from
`run_anaFit.py`.

### 4.2 Import mechanics (non-negotiable, Python chunks)

`run_anaFit.py` is invoked in production by the launcher scripts as a
direct executable by absolute path, after `cd`-ing to the repository root.
No `PYTHONPATH` is ever set. Python auto-prepends the invoked script's
**own** directory (`python/`) to `sys.path[0]` when a `.py` file is run
this way — confirmed directly: `import python.repo_utils` only succeeds
when the repository root is separately on `sys.path` (as under pytest, via
`pyproject.toml`'s `pythonpath = ["."]`); a bare `import repo_utils` does
not, under the same conditions.

Therefore:
- Every import between the seven new `run_anaFit.py` modules, and every
  import `run_anaFit.py` makes of them, **must use the flat sibling style**
  (`from run_execution import execute`) — never `from python.run_execution
  import execute`. `plot_edm.py` (repository root) and `plotPostFit.py`
  (`python/`) are each invoked standalone (`execute("python plot_edm.py
  ...")`, `python "$repo_dir/python/plotPostFit.py" ...`), not imported by
  another module, so this constraint applies only to their own internal
  function organization, not to any cross-module import.
- Test files importing a module directly (not through `run_anaFit.py`) may
  use the dotted `from python.run_execution import ...` namespace-package
  style already established by `tests/test_repo_utils.py` — **only** for a
  module that does not do a module-level `import ROOT` (or similar).
- Per-module import placement:

  | Module | ROOT-touching? | Import placement |
  |---|---|---|
  | `run_execution.py` | No | top-level |
  | `run_manifest.py` | No | top-level |
  | `run_masking.py` | No | top-level |
  | `run_provenance.py` | Only `collect_scientific_runtime` | `import ROOT` deferred inside that one function; everything else top-level |
  | `run_templates.py` | Only the prefit branch | `from PreFit import PreFitter` deferred inside the `doprefit` handling |
  | `run_fit.py` | The whole function | `import ROOT`, `from ExtractPostfitFromWS import PostfitExtractor`, `from ExtractFitParameters import FitParameterExtractor` deferred inside `build_fit_extract`, placed immediately before the first `ROOT.TFile(...)` use |
  | `run_cli.py` | No | top-level |
  | `plot_edm.py` (Chunk 9) | No | top-level (already ROOT-free — matplotlib only) |
  | `plotPostFit.py` (Chunk 10) | Yes (whole file) | top-level (this file is already ROOT-only end to end; there is no non-ROOT subset worth isolating) |

  This is a reorganization of where existing import statements live, not a
  new dependency and not a behavior change. Payoff: most new Python test
  files need zero `ROOT`/sibling-module stubbing and can use the plain
  dotted-import style; only tests exercising `collect_scientific_runtime`,
  the `doprefit` branch, or `build_fit_extract` stub `sys.modules[...]`
  around that one call.

### 4.3 Plotting-layer decomposition (Chunks 9–11)

| File | New/renamed functions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `plot_edm.py` | `parse_minuit_edm_log(filename) -> (cumulative_x, edm_values, star_indices)` (**new**); `plot_minuit_edm_trace(cumulative_x, edm_values, star_indices, outname) -> None` (**new**); `plot_minuit_continuous(filename, outname)` (existing, becomes a thin orchestrator calling the two above) | Separates log parsing (pure, trivially unit-testable) from matplotlib rendering. |
| `python/plotPostFit.py` | `parse_args(argv=None) -> argparse.Namespace` (**new**); `load_postfit_histograms(input_file) -> PostfitHistograms` (**new**, a small namedtuple of `postfit`/`data`/`chi2`); `build_ratio_histogram(data, postfit) -> TH1` (**new**); `draw_postfit_canvas(data, postfit, chi2_hist, ratio_hist) -> TCanvas` (**new**); `main(argv=None) -> None` (**new**, orchestrates the above, then `canvas.SaveAs(...)`); `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` (**new**) | Currently zero functions exist; this chunk introduces the file's first `main()`/`__main__` guard, which is itself the textbook motivating case for this refactor. |
| `plot_postfit.cpp` | `BumpHunterInfo read_bumphunter_results(std::string const& bh_log_name)` (**new** struct + free function, replaces the inline lambda + loose locals); `PostfitHistograms load_postfit_histograms(TFile*, TFile*, TFile*, TFile*)` (**new** struct + free function); `void draw_residual_panel(TCanvas*, TH1D* first, TH1D* second, bool bump_hunter, BumpHunterInfo const&, char const* pars_str, char const* out_file_name)` (**new**, the loop body parameterized so the existing loop calls it 3×); `void plot_postfit(char const* in_dir, char const* pars_str)` (**existing signature preserved exactly** — the shell launcher invokes this by name, do not rename or reorder its parameters) | First C++ decomposition; Chunk 11 also introduces the first ROOT-macro test in this repository. |

### 4.4 Five hot-path support files → decomposed, tested, registered (Chunks 13–17, added 2026-09-04)

All five are ROOT- or heavy-dependency-coupled end to end, or nearly so —
unlike Chunks 1–8's mostly ROOT-free orchestration code, the decomposition
value here is smaller and more variable per file; each chunk states
honestly how much genuine decomposition exists rather than forcing a
uniform split. None of the five imports another one of the five, or is
imported by another — each is reachable only through a single, already
Tier-3 caller module, so the five chunks below have no ordering dependency
on each other; they are sequenced by ascending design risk instead (Chunk
13 first, Chunk 17 last — see each chunk's own text).

| File | New/renamed functions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `python/createBinning.py` (Chunk 13) | `parse_args(argv=None)` (**new**); `load_resolution_fit(input_path=...)` (**new**); `resolve_bin_edges(reso_fit, rangelow, rangehigh)` (**new** — the one fragment testable with zero ROOT, since it only needs an object exposing `.Eval(x)`); `build_binning_histogram(bin_edges)` (**new**); `main(argv=None)` (**new**) plus a **new** `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard | Direct structural clone of Chunk 10's `plotPostFit.py` precedent: zero functions today, no `main()`, no `__main__` guard — this file always executes top-to-bottom on import today, which this chunk fixes as a side effect of the same transform, not a separate goal. |
| `python/FindBHWindow.py` (Chunk 14) | `NpEncoder` (unchanged); `parse_args(argv=None)` (**new**); `load_histograms(input_file)` (**new**); `crop_data_to_background_range(data_edges, data_counts, bkg_edges)` (**new** — the one fragment testable with only a `numpy` stub, once given plain arrays); `run_bump_hunter(data_counts, data_edges, bkg_counts, bkg_edges)` (**new**); `compute_mask_window(bump_hunter, use_bin_numbers)` (**new** — keeps the `--usebinnumbers` vs. default formulas as two distinct branches, not merged); `save_bump_plots(bump_hunter)` (**new**); `write_mask_window_json(out_dict, outputjson)` (**new**); `main(argv=None)` (existing, becomes the orchestrator — stays the real, only entry point, since this file is always invoked as a whole subprocess under its own dedicated interpreter, never imported) | Mirrors Chunk 9's `plot_edm.py` parse/plot split. Also defers `matplotlib`/`uproot`/`pyBumpHunter`'s currently-module-level imports into the specific functions that need them, keeping only `numpy`+stdlib at module scope — see Chunk 14's own "Decisions recorded during extraction" entry once written (mirroring Chunks 9–11's pattern) for why. |
| `python/ExtractFitParameters.py` (Chunk 15) | No new decomposition of `Extract()`/`WriteRoot()`/the 5 accessors — stated explicitly in Chunk 15 as an honest minimal-decomposition case: `Extract()` (42 lines) is one cohesive block, and forcing a 3-way split would relocate, not reduce, its complexity | This chunk's value is the file's first-ever direct test of its real behavior, plus registration — not restructuring. |
| `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` (Chunk 16) | `getNPars`/`expHist`/`getChi2` stay free functions (`getChi2`'s external mutation of the `extractor` object passed to it is preserved exactly, not converted into a method); `PostfitExtractor.Extract()` (137 lines, the largest method across all nine files) decomposes into new private methods `_open_workspace_and_data`, `_build_channel_postfit_histogram`, `_build_bkgonly_variant`, `_apply_external_rebinning`, with `Extract()` becoming the orchestrator; `WriteRoot()`/the 8 accessors/`GetCategories()` stay undecomposed one-liners | The primary decomposition target of the five files. Two dormant, currently-unreachable bugs found by direct reading are characterized and preserved by Chunk 16 itself, then optionally fixed by separate, dedicated Chunks 16a/16b — never inside Chunk 16's own extraction commit. |
| `python/PreFit.py` (Chunk 17) | `RandomizeParameters` (unchanged); `_build_candidate_functions(self, ...)` (**new**, private); `_select_best_parameter_sets(self, ...)` (**new**, private — the one piece of this file that becomes independently testable once separated from the surrounding ROOT calls); `Fit(self)` (existing, becomes the orchestrator) | Zero existing test coverage of `PreFitter`'s own real behavior anywhere today (the only existing test fakes the whole class, to test `run_templates.py`'s caller logic). |

### 4.5 Import placement and testing tiers for the five hot-path files

**Corrected after Chunks 13–16 actually landed** (this paragraph
originally undercounted the deferred-import files as one; GitHub
Copilot review, PR #7, caught the discrepancy against the shipped
code): two of the five, `createBinning.py` (Chunk 13) and
`FindBHWindow.py` (Chunk 14), defer their heavy imports into the
specific functions that need them —
`createBinning.py`'s `import ROOT` moves into `load_resolution_fit()`/
`build_binning_histogram()`/`main()`, leaving `parse_args()`/
`resolve_bin_edges()` ROOT-free at both module and call scope, exactly
like `FindBHWindow.py`'s own `matplotlib`/`uproot`/`pyBumpHunter`
deferrals (Chunk 14). The remaining three — `ExtractFitParameters.py`
(Chunk 15), `ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` (Chunk 16), and `PreFit.py`
(Chunk 17, not yet executed) — keep a module-level `import ROOT` today,
unlike `run_fit.py`'s own deferred `import ROOT`: there is no ROOT-free
subset of these three files worth isolating by deferring the import
(confirmed directly: `PreFit.py`'s `__init__` already touches
`ROOT.Math.MinimizerOptions`/`ROOT.TRandom3` immediately; the other
two's only ROOT-free code is trivial attribute storage).

This repository's own dev venv (`.venv/bin/python`, used for
`scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` and all fast/unmarked tests)
cannot import `ROOT`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, or `uproot` at all — a false
positive for `import pyBumpHunter` resolves to this repository's own
top-level `pyBumpHunter/` directory as a namespace package, not the real
library, and still fails on `import pyBumpHunter.BH`. All five chunks
therefore reuse this plan's own established two-tier testing approach
(Section 4.2's payoff paragraph, already applied to
`run_provenance.py`'s `collect_scientific_runtime()` and
`run_templates.py`'s `doprefit` path): a `sys.modules`-stubbed
(`ModuleType`) fast tier for whatever each file's own logic doesn't
actually need a real dependency for, and a real, marked
(`requires_root`+`requires_analysis_dependencies`) subprocess/fixture
tier — reusing already-committed J100 fixtures wherever production
actually points at one (Chunks 15 and 16), or a small synthetic fixture
built on the fly where none is committed (Chunk 13; Chunk 17 uses real
committed data but a deliberately reduced scale for speed) — for what
can only be proven against the real dependency. `FindBHWindow.py`
additionally needs a `numpy` `ModuleType` stub (a **new** stub target for
this plan, `numpy` was not previously stubbed anywhere in Chunks 0–12)
for its fast tier, since even `numpy` itself is unavailable in the dev
venv.

## 5. The chunk delivery model

### Revision note (read this first)

The original version of this section required each chunk step to be its
own pull request, opened and merged on GitHub before the next step could
even begin. In practice, executing Chunk 0 and Chunk 1 showed that isn't
how this project actually reviews changes: the repository owner chose, when
asked directly, to verify each characterization step **conversationally in
session** (reading the actual test code and a real trace of its output,
then explicitly confirming) rather than by opening a separate GitHub PR
per step and waiting for a merge event between them. GitHub Copilot's
automated review of the resulting single PR correctly flagged the
mismatch between that practice and this section's original wording. This
section is rewritten to describe the process actually being followed,
which preserves every substantive safety property the original wording
was for — tests written and verified against unmodified code before any
extraction — without requiring an artifact (a separately merged PR) that
this project doesn't actually produce between steps.

### Every chunk is delivered as two ordered steps, Step A then Step B

**Step A — Characterization (tests only, zero production-code changes)**,
delivered as its own commit. Adds tests that pin down the **current,
unmodified** behavior of the chunk's target function(s) — for a file with
existing functions, this usually means calling them exactly as they exist
today (in-place, not yet extracted); for `plotPostFit.py` (no functions
yet) and `plot_postfit.cpp` (no test harness yet) it means an end-to-end
characterization: run the current script/macro against a fixture input,
assert on its real, observable output (file created, non-empty, or a
specific extracted value), exactly the "freeze the outputs... assert
every future run reproduces them" pattern already established for Tier 1.

**Step A's commit must not touch the target production file at all**
(touching a *test* file, or a *new* test file, is the entire content of
the commit — confirm with `git diff --stat` before committing). This is
what makes "tests are written and human-verified... before files are
modified" a structural property of the process, not a checklist item that
could be skipped.

**Required human-verification checkpoint before Step B's commit is
made**: a human reviewer (not the LLM authoring the change) must, in the
session, before any extraction work begins:
1. Run the new tests locally against the target file as it stood before
   Step A's commit (i.e. before any Tier 3 change to that file) and
   confirm they pass — or review a trace of them doing so.
2. Read each new test and confirm it asserts something meaningful about a
   real input, output, or side effect of the target function(s) — not
   merely that the call "does not raise."
3. Give explicit, recorded confirmation (e.g. "verified, proceed" in the
   session, or the equivalent) before Step B's commit is made. Record that
   this happened, and how, in Step B's activity-log entry — this is the
   record that substitutes for a separate merged PR.

**Step A activity-log entry template** (this content is what gets
appended to `doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` as Step A's commit):

```markdown
## Chunk <N>.A — Characterization tests for <target file/function(s)>

### Objective
Pin down the current, unmodified behavior of <function(s)> in <file>
before any extraction, per doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md Chunk <N>.

### Target functions — inputs and outputs (as they exist today)
| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Tests added
- `test_x` — exercises <input>, asserts <output/side-effect>.
- (one row per new test function)

### What this commit does NOT do
No production file is modified. <file> is unchanged byte-for-byte in this
diff — confirm with `git diff --stat`.

### Verification performed
- `python -m pytest <new_test_file> -v` → result, all passing.
- `git diff --stat` → only the new test file(s) appear.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Characterization variant)
- [ ] Base commit for these tests is named and matches the file's current state.
- [ ] Every new test asserts a real output/side-effect, not just "no exception."
- [ ] `git diff --stat` shows no production file touched.
- [ ] Tests were run (or a real trace of them was reviewed) by a human, not only reported by the author.
- [ ] Explicit human-verification confirmation given and recorded before Step B's commit.
```

**Step B — Extraction**, delivered as its own commit, made only after
Step A's human-verification checkpoint above. Moves the now-characterized
function(s) into their target module (or, for
`plotPostFit.py`/`plot_postfit.cpp`, restructures the file in place),
relocating Step A's tests per the **Test Relocation Rule** below, and adds
any further tests guardrail 4 requires for newly-introduced functions
(e.g. `should_mask()`, `prepare_run_templates()`, `parse_args()`).

**Test Relocation Rule**: move each test from Step A's file into its final
home **verbatim except for the import statement** — do not alter fixture
setup, assertions, or expected values while moving. Delete the old copy in
the same commit that deletes the corresponding function definition from
the source file. Any test that exercises the moved function only *through*
a higher-level entry point (e.g. a coordinator-level or end-to-end test)
stays where it is — it is testing integration, not the moved unit, and
does not relocate.

**Step B activity-log entry template**:

```markdown
## Chunk <N>.B — Extract <target> into <new module/function(s)>

### Objective
Move <function(s)>, characterized and human-verified in Step A (commit
<short-sha>), into <new module/file structure>, per
doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md Chunk <N>.

### What changed
- `<new file>` created, containing <functions>, moved <verbatim / with the
  one documented exception: ...>.
- `<old file>` updated: <function(s)> removed, replaced with a call to
  `<new module>.<function>`.
- Tests relocated from Step A's `<test file>` to `<final test file>`
  (import path only changed; assertions unchanged — confirm with a diff).
- New tests added for newly-introduced functions: <list>.
- `scripts/quality_check.py` updated: `<new file>`/`<new test file>` added
  to `python_targets`/`test_targets`.

### Confirm: no scientific behavior changed
State explicitly, or (Chunks 4 and 5 only) describe precisely what real
control-flow changed and why it's safe, backed by the mandatory
integration-gate rerun for those two chunks.

### Verification performed
- Focused test command + result (relocated + new tests).
- `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full` → result.
- Integration-gate rerun, if this chunk requires it (Chunks 4, 5) → result.
- `git diff --check` → result.

### Compliance review (Section 8, Extraction variant)
- [ ] Step A's commit is named/linked; this commit's tests are the relocated ones, not newly invented.
- [ ] Diffed test files show only import-line changes for relocated tests.
- [ ] Production code actually calls the new function (grep, don't assume).
- [ ] No extracted module imports from the coordinator/original file.
- [ ] All required gates in Section 7 ran and passed, output captured.
- [ ] Activity-log entry appended (this content), not a rewrite of any existing section.
```

### Why two steps, not one commit

Mixing "add tests" and "move code" in one commit forces a reviewer to
simultaneously judge whether the tests are trustworthy *and* whether the
move preserved behavior, using the same tests as evidence for both — which
is circular if the tests themselves were written after the code moved.
The split keeps each step small, each with one honest question a reviewer
can answer independently: Step A — "do these tests actually describe what
the code does today?"; Step B — "does the moved code still pass the tests
we already agreed describe it?"

### What actually gets reviewed on GitHub

Individual steps are not each opened as their own GitHub pull request.
Work accumulates as ordered commits on the working branch (Step A, then
Step B, then the next chunk's Step A, and so on), and a pull request is
opened covering one chunk or a small, clearly-labeled batch of chunks
and/or standalone fixes, for final review. What guardrail 7 actually
requires is that within that PR's commit history, the Step A / Step B
ordering and separation is real and inspectable — not that GitHub shows a
separate merged PR per step. A reviewer (human or automated) can still
verify the split by reading the commits in order: does an
add-only-tests commit exist before a production-code-changing commit for
the same target, and does the activity log record the human-verification
checkpoint between them.

---

## 6. Chunks

Work through these **in order**; within a chunk, Step A's commit before
Step B's commit, with the Section 5 human-verification checkpoint between
them. Do not start the next chunk's Step A until the current chunk's Step
B commit is made and its gates pass.

### Chunk 0 — Pre-flight baseline confirmation (single commit, no code change)

**Objective**: Prove the branch is in the fully-passing state Section 2
claims before any Tier 3 work begins.

**Commit content**: no code change. Run every gate in Section 7 with
nothing staged; record exact pass/fail counts as a new
`doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` entry ("Tier-3 pre-flight baseline"), made as its
own tiny, standalone commit so the baseline is itself reviewable and
citable by every later chunk.

**Acceptance check**: all three gates in Section 7 exit 0. If any does
not, stop — fix or explicitly scope out the failure before Chunk 1, and
record that decision in the activity log.

---

### Chunk 1 — `run_execution.py`

**Target functions** (unmodified, in `python/run_anaFit.py` today):

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `execute(cmd)` | `cmd: str` | `int` (subprocess return code) | runs `cmd` via `subprocess.call(shell=True)`; prints `"EXECUTE: {cmd}"` |
| `execute_required(cmd, description, expected_outputs=())` | `cmd: str`, `description: str`, `expected_outputs: Sequence[str]` | `bool` | deletes any pre-existing `expected_outputs` before running; prints diagnostics on failure |

**Rationale**: no dependency on anything else in `run_anaFit.py` (no ROOT,
no provenance, no XML handling) and used by nearly every later chunk —
extracting first gives every later chunk a stable, already-tested import.

**Step A — characterization**: write/relocate-source
`test_execute_required_accepts_success_with_expected_output`,
`test_execute_required_rejects_stale_expected_output`,
`test_execute_required_rejects_nonzero_command_status`,
`test_execute_required_rejects_missing_expected_output` — these already
exist in `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`; for this chunk, Step A is "confirm they
already characterize `execute`/`execute_required`'s current behavior and
get the required human-verification comment on the *existing* tests" (no
new test file yet — the move happens in Step B). If review finds a gap
(e.g. `execute()` itself has no direct test), add it here, against the
unmodified file, before Step B.

**Step B — extraction**:
- Create `python/run_execution.py` containing `execute()` and
  `execute_required()`, moved verbatim.
- Update `run_anaFit.py` to `from run_execution import execute,
  execute_required` — flat sibling style (Section 4.2). Never `from
  python.run_execution import ...` here.
- **Blocking step, required for this step's own acceptance check to pass**:
  `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` loads `run_anaFit.py` via
  `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(...)` + `exec_module(...)`,
  which does **not** put `python/` on `sys.path` (no `conftest.py` exists
  under `tests/`; pytest's `pythonpath = ["."]` only adds the repository
  root). The moment `run_anaFit.py` contains a real `from run_execution
  import ...` line, `exec_module` raises `ModuleNotFoundError` unless
  fixed first. Update the module-loading helper to prepend `python/`'s own
  directory to `sys.path` before `exec_module`, e.g.
  `monkeypatch.syspath_prepend(str(module_path.parent))`, mirroring what
  the interpreter does automatically in production. Do this before adding
  the new import.
- Apply the Test Relocation Rule for the four tests above into a new
  `tests/test_run_execution.py`. `run_execution.py` never touches `ROOT`
  or any sibling module, so this file may use the plain `from
  python.run_execution import execute, execute_required` style — no
  stubbing needed.
- Register both new files in `scripts/quality_check.py`.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_run_execution.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v
grep -n "^def execute\b\|^def execute_required\b" python/run_anaFit.py   # must return nothing
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

---

### Chunk 2 — `run_manifest.py`

**Target function**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `write_analysis_results(folder, p_chi2, masked, provenance)` | `folder: str`, `p_chi2: float`, `masked: bool`, `provenance: dict` | `str` (path to the written manifest) | atomically writes `<folder>/analysis_results.json` (schema v2) via a temp file + `os.replace` |

**Rationale**: a pure "assemble payload, write atomically" function, no
dependency on fit-execution or provenance logic beyond receiving
already-computed values — a low-risk second extraction.

**Step A**: confirm the existing
`test_write_analysis_results_writes_success_manifest`,
`test_write_analysis_results_records_masked_fit`,
`test_write_analysis_results_atomically_replaces_existing_manifest`
characterize current behavior (same human-verification process as Chunk
1's Step A); add any missing case against the unmodified file first.

**Step B**:
- Create `python/run_manifest.py` containing `write_analysis_results()`,
  moved verbatim.
- Update `run_anaFit.py`'s import (flat sibling style).
- Apply the Test Relocation Rule for the three tests above into a new
  `tests/test_run_manifest.py`.
- Register both new files.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_run_manifest.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

---

### Chunk 3 — `run_provenance.py`

**Target functions**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_repository_root()` | none | `Path` | raises `RuntimeError` if no `.git` found |
| `resolve_analysis_path(path, repository_root=None)` | `path: str`, optional `repository_root` | `Path` | raises `FileNotFoundError` if missing |
| `calculate_file_sha256(path)` | `path` | `str` (hex digest) | reads the file in chunks |
| `build_file_provenance(path, repository_root=None)` | as above | `dict {"path", "sha256"}` | — |
| `get_git_revision(repository_path)` | `repository_path` | `str` (40-hex SHA) | runs `git rev-parse HEAD` + `git status --porcelain`; warns (does not fail) on a dirty tree |
| `collect_scientific_runtime()` | none | `dict {"python_version","python_executable","root_version"}` | requires `ROOT` importable |
| `build_analysis_provenance(datafile, datahist, topfile, categoryfile, backgroundfile, signalfile, rangelow, rangehigh, dosignal, dolimit, doprefit, maskthreshold)` | as listed | full provenance `dict` | calls all of the above |

**Rationale**: repository discovery → path resolution → hashing → Git
revision → runtime collection → payload assembly is one coherent pipeline,
consumed by the coordinator as a single call. Largest extraction by line
count, lowest risk — every function is a pure read of the filesystem, Git,
or the ROOT runtime.

**Step A**: confirm the existing tests
(`test_calculate_file_sha256_*`, `test_get_git_revision_*`,
`test_collect_scientific_runtime_*`, `test_get_repository_root_*`,
`test_resolve_analysis_path_*`, `test_build_file_provenance_*`,
`test_build_analysis_provenance_*`) characterize current behavior; add any
gap against the unmodified file first, with the required human-
verification comment.

**Step B**:
- Create `python/run_provenance.py` containing all seven functions, moved
  verbatim and preserving call order/error handling exactly, **with one
  narrow, justified exception**: `get_repository_root()` should call
  `python/repo_utils.py`'s existing `find_repo_root()` (flat import: `from
  repo_utils import find_repo_root`) for the base-path computation, then
  layer the existing `.git`-existence check and `RuntimeError` on top
  locally. Both functions compute the identical
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1])` expression independently today —
  same inputs, same output, since both files live directly under
  `python/` — so this removes a real duplication while touching zero
  lines in `repo_utils.py` and preserving `get_repository_root()`'s exact
  signature, return value, and exception behavior. Do not apply this
  reuse treatment anywhere else in this chunk.
- Apply the import-placement table (Section 4.2): `collect_scientific_runtime`'s
  `import ROOT` moves inside that one function; everything else stays
  top-level and plainly importable.
- Update `run_anaFit.py`'s import to pull `build_analysis_provenance`
  (flat sibling style).
- Apply the Test Relocation Rule into a new `tests/test_run_provenance.py`.
  Because only `collect_scientific_runtime` touches `ROOT`, only its tests
  need `sys.modules["ROOT"]` stubbing; every other relocated test can
  import the module plainly (`from python.run_provenance import ...`) —
  realize this simplification, don't just permit it.
- Register both new files.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_run_provenance.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

---

### Chunk 4 — `run_masking.py` (extract shared masking-threshold predicate — no operator or behavior change)

**Target functions**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `load_bumphunter_results(results_file)` | `results_file: str` | `dict {"BlindRange","MaskMin","MaskMax"}` | raises `ValueError` on malformed input |
| `run_bumphunter(postfitfile, folder)` | `postfitfile: str`, `folder: str` | same shape as above | deletes stale `BHresults.json`; runs the BumpHunter subprocess; raises `RuntimeError` on failure |
| `should_mask(p_value, threshold)` (**new**) | `p_value: float`, `threshold: float` | `bool` | none (pure) |

**Rationale**: `run_anaFit()` decides whether to mask using `if
pval_global > maskthreshold`, and separately whether the masked refit is
accepted using `if pval_masked > maskthreshold`. Both call sites already
use the exact same `>` comparison — **there is no mismatch between them
today**; what's missing is a shared name. The same business rule ("a
p-value at or below the mask threshold requires masking/refit") is written
out twice, independently, with no single place that states it — precisely
what extract-function refactors exist for, because duplicated conditions
are exactly what silently drifts unnoticed later.

**Step A**: confirm the existing `load_bumphunter_results`/`run_bumphunter`
tests (`test_load_bumphunter_results_accepts_valid_payload`,
`test_load_bumphunter_results_rejects_malformed_json`,
`test_load_bumphunter_results_rejects_missing_keys`,
`test_load_bumphunter_results_rejects_invalid_mask_limits`,
`test_run_bumphunter_removes_stale_output_and_loads_fresh_results`,
`test_run_bumphunter_propagates_command_failure`,
`test_run_bumphunter_rejects_success_without_fresh_output`,
`test_run_bumphunter_rejects_invalid_fresh_output`) characterize current
behavior. `should_mask()` does not exist yet, so it has no
characterization step — its tests are written fresh in Step B under
guardrail 4, since there is no "original behavior" to pin down beyond the
two inline `>` comparisons already covered by the coordinator-level tests
that stay in `tests/test_run_anaFit.py` per the Test Relocation Rule's
point on integration tests.

**Step B**:
- Create `python/run_masking.py` containing `load_bumphunter_results()`
  and `run_bumphunter()`, moved verbatim.
- Add `should_mask(p_value, threshold)` returning `p_value <= threshold` —
  i.e. `True` exactly when the coordinator's existing `if pval_global >
  maskthreshold` branch would **not** be taken, matching the coordinator's
  current `>` convention precisely. Do not silently change the convention
  without also changing both coordinator call sites and documenting why.
- Replace both inline comparisons in `run_anaFit()` with calls to
  `should_mask()`, inverted as needed to preserve the exact existing
  control flow.
- Apply the Test Relocation Rule for the eight relocated tests into a new
  `tests/test_run_masking.py`.
- **New test required**: `test_should_mask_matches_coordinator_convention_at_exact_threshold`,
  asserting `should_mask(threshold, threshold)` returns the value that
  makes the coordinator take its masking branch (`should_mask(0.01, 0.01)
  is True`), plus one clearly-below and one clearly-above case.
- Register both new files.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
grep -n "maskthreshold" python/run_anaFit.py    # both remaining comparisons must call should_mask()
python -m pytest tests/test_run_masking.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v
```
The integration-gate run is **mandatory** in this Step B (not optional):
this chunk changes a real branch condition inside the coordinator, and the
real J100/J50 rerun is the only proof the rewritten condition still
produces the unmasked accept path both canonical workflows currently take.

---

### Chunk 5 — `run_templates.py`

**Target functions**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `replaceinfile(f, old_new_list)` | `f: str`, `old_new_list: list[tuple[str,str]]` | `None` | rewrites `f` in place, applying each `re.sub` in order |
| `prepare_run_templates(...)` (**new**, replacing the ~150-line inline block) | `folder`, `topfile`, `categoryfile`, `backgroundfile`, `signalfile`, `signame`, `wsfile`, `sigmean`, `sigwidth`, `datafile`, `datahist`, `rangelow`, `rangehigh`, `doprefit`, `systdict` — finalize the exact set while reading the current block; record the final signature in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` (Chunk 12) | at minimum the resolved `tmptopfile`, any updated `nbkg`, and any `poi`/`signame` derived values the coordinator needs next — exact shape recorded once decided | copies/edits XML template files on disk; runs `PreFitter` when `doprefit` is set |

**Rationale**: the block inside `run_anaFit()` that copies the top/
category/signal/background XML templates, performs placeholder
substitution, and — when `doprefit` is set — parses parameter ranges and
runs `PreFitter` to seed initial values, is one coherent responsibility.
It is the single largest and most tangled block in `run_anaFit()` (~150 of
901 lines) and the primary reason the coordinator is hard to read. It
produces XML *template* files, not the RooFit `.root` workspace itself
(built later by `run_fit.py`) — hence `run_templates.py`, chosen to avoid
inviting confusion between the two.

**Step A — characterization, no unit tests exist today**: this block has
**no existing direct tests** — only indirect coverage through the full
J100/J50 integration gate. Step A therefore writes the **first** direct
tests against the current inline block, calling into `run_anaFit()`
end-to-end with controlled inputs (matching the coordinator-level testing
style already used in `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`) and asserting on the
generated XML files' contents — this is a genuine characterization step,
not a formality, since it is the first time this logic gets pinned down at
all. Minimum coverage:
- template files copied and placeholders substituted correctly for a
  representative non-prefit, non-signal case (assert on resulting file
  contents);
- the `doprefit=True` path invokes parameter-range parsing and seeds the
  background file with fitted initial values (controlled test double for
  `PreFitter`, per `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s ROOT-facing-tools policy);
- a signal-file case with `systdict` populated correctly substitutes the
  systematic-uncertainty placeholders;
- a **regression test for a real, verified quirk** in the current code:
  the `nPars` detection is `if "three" in backgroundfile: nPars = 3` as a
  standalone `if`, followed by a **separate** `elif` chain covering
  `"four"` through `"ten"` — not one unified `if/elif` ladder. A
  background-file name matching both `"three"` and `"four"` currently
  resolves to `nPars = 4`, not `3`. This is existing behavior, confirmed
  by reading the source; Step A's test pins it down exactly as-is so Step B
  cannot accidentally "clean it up" into a single chain, which would
  silently change behavior for any filename matching two of these
  substrings.
- `replaceinfile()`'s own characterization (it has no direct test either):
  assert it applies a list of `(old, new)` regex substitutions to a file
  in place.

Human-verification checkpoint applies as in Section 5, with extra weight
here since these are first-ever tests for this logic, not a relocation.

**Step B**:
- Create `python/run_templates.py` containing `replaceinfile()` moved
  verbatim. Decompose the templating/prefit block internally into at
  least two private helpers, called from one public entry point (moving it
  intact as one 150-line function would only relocate the tangle, not fix
  it):
  - `_stage_xml_templates(...)` — the template copy and
    placeholder-substitution logic;
  - `_seed_prefit_parameters(...)` — the `doprefit` branch: regex-parsing
    `[PARn,lo,hi]` ranges, running `PreFitter`, substituting fitted seed
    values back in. **Copy the `nPars` if/elif structure exactly as-is**
    (see Step A's regression test above) — do not unify it.
- Apply the import-placement rule: `from PreFit import PreFitter` moves
  inside `_seed_prefit_parameters`'s `doprefit` handling.
- Update `run_anaFit()` to call the new public entry point.
- Move Step A's tests into `tests/test_run_templates.py` per the Test
  Relocation Rule, scoping ROOT/PreFitter stubbing only to the
  `_seed_prefit_parameters` calls (the rest of the module needs none, per
  Section 4.2).
- Register both new files.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_run_templates.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v
```
The integration-gate run is **mandatory**: this is the riskiest single
extraction in the plan (real template-generation logic, not an
already-isolated pure function), and only the real J100/J50 rerun proves
the generated XML is byte-for-byte equivalent in the ways that matter to
the fit.

### Chunk 6 — `run_fit.py`

**Target function**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build_fit_extract(topfile, datafile, datahist, rangelow, rangehigh, wsfile, fitresultfile, poi=None, maskrange=None)` | as listed | `(pval: float, postfitfile: str, parameterfile: str)` | runs XMLReader + quickFit subprocesses; writes ROOT files; may generate a resolution-binning file; shells out to `plot_edm.py` (Chunk 9) |

**Rationale**: the second half of the coordinator (XMLReader → quickFit →
`PostfitExtractor`/`FitParameterExtractor`), already called twice
(unmasked, masked refit) with no logic difference other than arguments —
already function-shaped, just needs to move.

**Step A**: confirm the two existing failure-path tests
(`test_build_fit_extract_stops_after_xmlreader_failure`,
`test_build_fit_extract_stops_after_quickfit_failure`) characterize
current behavior. These only cover failure paths (Section 2's baseline);
Step A adds the missing successful-path characterization against the
**unmodified** function first:
- a successful unmasked call returning the expected `(pval, postfitfile,
  parameterfile)` shape, using controlled test doubles for
  `PostfitExtractor`, `FitParameterExtractor`, and the
  `ROOT.TFile`/histogram lookup used for `datafirstbin`;
- a successful masked call (`maskrange` provided), asserting the mask
  range reaches the quickFit command and the correct normalized-p-value
  source (`Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned` vs. `Run3TLA_rebinned`) is selected.

**Step B**:
- Create `python/run_fit.py` containing `build_fit_extract()`, moved
  verbatim. It needs **both** `execute` and `execute_required` from
  `run_execution.py` (`execute` for the `plot_edm.py` diagnostic call and
  the conditional `createBinning.py` call; `execute_required` for
  XMLReader and quickFit) — `from run_execution import execute,
  execute_required`, flat sibling style.
- Apply the import-placement rule: defer `import ROOT`, `from
  ExtractPostfitFromWS import PostfitExtractor`, `from
  ExtractFitParameters import FitParameterExtractor` inside
  `build_fit_extract` itself, immediately before the first
  `ROOT.TFile(...)` line (after both `execute_required` calls succeed).
  Confirm once relocated that the two failure-path tests need **no**
  `ROOT`/sibling-module stubbing at all (they return before reaching the
  deferred import) — if they still need stubbing, the import was placed
  too early.
- Update `run_anaFit.py`'s import (flat sibling style).
- Apply the Test Relocation Rule for the two existing tests plus Step A's
  two new ones into `tests/test_run_fit.py`.
- Register both new files.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_run_fit.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

---

### Chunk 7 — `run_cli.py`

**Target functions** (both new — extracted from inline logic in `main()`):

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build_arg_parser()` | none | `argparse.ArgumentParser` | none |
| `normalize_signal_name(sigmean, sigwidth, signame)` | `sigmean`, `sigwidth`, `signame` (possibly `None`) | `str` | none (pure) |

**Rationale**: `main()`'s argument parsing and signal-name default logic
are presentation/entry-point concerns, separable from `run_anaFit()`'s
scientific orchestration. Last extraction; leaves `run_anaFit.py` as close
to a pure coordinator as this plan gets.

**Step A**: this logic has no existing dedicated test (only indirect
coverage via `test_main_propagates_analysis_status`). Characterize the
**current inline logic in `main()`** first, calling `main()`/re-deriving
its argument-parsing behavior against the unmodified file:
- default-name construction for a normal width, an integer-valued float
  width (`7.0` — assert whatever `str(7.0)` currently produces in the
  naming string is preserved, since it's easy to accidentally "clean up"
  this during extraction by switching to `%g`-style formatting that turns
  `7.0` into `7`), and the `sigwidth == -999` Zprime-naming branch;
- a representative full set of CLI flags (mirroring an actual invocation
  from `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`) parses into the expected values.

**Step B**:
- Create `python/run_cli.py` containing `build_arg_parser()` (covering
  exactly the arguments `main()` currently registers) and
  `normalize_signal_name()` (the exact default-naming logic, behavior
  preserved per Step A's `7.0` regression test).
- Update `run_anaFit.py`'s `main()` to call `run_cli.build_arg_parser()`
  and `run_cli.normalize_signal_name()` instead of containing this logic
  inline, then call `run_anaFit()` exactly as before.
- Move Step A's tests into `tests/test_run_cli.py`.
- Apply the Test Relocation Rule to `test_main_propagates_analysis_status`
  only if it turns out to test parsing behavior directly — if it only
  tests status propagation through `main()` end-to-end, it stays in
  `tests/test_run_anaFit.py`.
- Register both new files.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_run_cli.py tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

---

### Chunk 8 — Coordinator slimming and dependency-direction verification (single commit, verification only)

**Objective**: With Chunks 1–7 done, confirm `run_anaFit()` now reads as
an orchestration of calls into the seven new modules, not a container for
their logic. This is a checkpoint, not a new extraction — **no new target
function exists here, so guardrail 3's two-step/characterization-first
pattern does not apply**; there is nothing new to characterize before
modifying, only a verification pass over work already characterized and
extracted in Chunks 1–7. Deliver as a single commit.

**Commit content**:
- Re-read `run_anaFit.py` top to bottom. It should contain only: imports,
  `run_anaFit()`, `main()`, and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. If
  any extracted logic was copied rather than moved, remove the duplicate.
  If `run_anaFit()` still directly contains logic belonging to one of the
  seven modules, finish moving it and update that chunk's tests
  accordingly — do not leave partial extractions.
- Register `python/run_anaFit.py` itself with the Tier 2 quality gate: it
  is currently **absent** from `scripts/quality_check.py`'s
  `python_targets` (not ruff/black-checked today, even though its test
  file is checked). At ~60–100 lines it is now small enough. Add its path
  and run `python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full`, fixing any
  remaining findings in the coordinator itself.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
wc -l python/run_anaFit.py     # record the resulting line count in the activity log
python -c "
import ast, pathlib
tree = ast.parse(pathlib.Path('python/run_anaFit.py').read_text())

python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py -m "integration and requires_root" -v
```

### Chunk 9 — `plot_edm.py`

**Target function** (single function today, being split into two):

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plot_minuit_continuous(filename, outname)` (existing) | `filename: str` (quickFit log path), `outname: str` | `None` | reads `filename`; prints "Error: The file was not found." and `sys.exit(1)` if missing; prints "No matching data found." and returns early if the log has no Minuit trace lines; otherwise builds and saves a matplotlib figure to `outname` |

**Target decomposition**:

| New function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `parse_minuit_edm_log(filename)` (**new**) | `filename: str` | `(cumulative_x: list[int], edm_values: list[float], star_indices: list[int])` | reads `filename`; preserve the exact current missing-file behavior (decide whether it stays `sys.exit(1)` inside the parse function or is converted to raising `FileNotFoundError` with the CLI wrapper doing the `sys.exit` — record the decision and its rationale in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`) |
| `plot_minuit_edm_trace(cumulative_x, edm_values, star_indices, outname)` (**new**) | as listed | `None` | builds and saves the matplotlib figure to `outname`; preserves the "No matching data found." early-return when `cumulative_x` is empty |
| `plot_minuit_continuous(filename, outname)` (unchanged signature) | as before | `None` | becomes a thin orchestrator: parse, then plot |

**Rationale**: separates log parsing (pure — trivially unit-testable with
a small fixture log file, no matplotlib needed) from rendering (needs
matplotlib; testable only for "does it run and produce a file," which is
still worth asserting).

**Step A — characterization**: `plot_edm.py` has no existing tests. Write
tests against the current, single `plot_minuit_continuous(filename,
outname)` function, using a small fixture log file with representative
Minuit trace lines (the existing committed
`run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/quickFitLog_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.log`
is a real, already-available fixture):
- a log with matching trace lines produces a non-empty output file;
- a log with no matching trace lines does not raise and does not create
  an output file (matches "No matching data found." + early return);
- a missing input file exits with status 1 (matches current
  `sys.exit(1)` behavior) — capture via `pytest.raises(SystemExit)` or
  subprocess invocation, whichever matches how the test needs to observe
  the current top-level script's behavior (the file has `if __name__ ==
  "__main__":` guard logic too — characterize that entry point directly if
  it's simplest).

**Step B**:
- Add `parse_minuit_edm_log()` and `plot_minuit_edm_trace()` to
  `plot_edm.py`, rewriting `plot_minuit_continuous()` to call both in
  sequence, preserving every current behavior Step A pinned down exactly.
- Relocate Step A's tests, updating only what the split requires (e.g.
  splitting one end-to-end assertion into a parse-level assertion plus a
  plot-level assertion where that's clearer) — do not silently drop
  coverage; if a test's assertion moves to a different function, say so
  explicitly in the commit's activity-log entry, don't just delete and re-add.
- **New tests required** for the two newly-introduced functions
  individually (guardrail 4): `parse_minuit_edm_log()` against the fixture
  log, asserting the exact parsed tuple contents (not just "returns
  something"); `plot_minuit_edm_trace()` given pre-parsed data, asserting
  it produces a non-empty output file.
- Register `plot_edm.py` and its new test file in
  `scripts/quality_check.py`.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_plot_edm.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```
No integration-gate rerun is required for this chunk — `plot_edm.py`'s
output is a diagnostic plot, already outside the scientific-acceptance
artifact contract per the existing `ANAFIT_SKIP_PLOTS` policy recorded in
`doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md`'s 2026-08-20 "Plotting separated from scientific
acceptance" entry.

---

### Chunk 10 — `python/plotPostFit.py`

**Current state**: zero functions — the entire 79-line file is top-level
script code. **Step A's characterization must therefore run the current
script end-to-end**, since there is nothing importable to call directly
yet.

**Target decomposition**:

| New function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `parse_args(argv=None)` (**new**) | `argv: list[str] \| None` | `argparse.Namespace` (`inputFile`, `output`) | none |
| `load_postfit_histograms(input_file)` (**new**) | `input_file: str` | a small `PostfitHistograms` namedtuple/dataclass (`postfit`, `data`, `chi2`) with styling already applied (marker/line style currently applied inline — decide whether styling stays in this function or moves to a separate `style_postfit_histograms()`; record the decision) | opens `input_file` via `ROOT.TFile.Open` |
| `build_ratio_histogram(data, postfit)` (**new**) | ROOT histograms | a styled ratio `TH1` | none beyond building the object |
| `draw_postfit_canvas(data, postfit, chi2_hist, ratio_hist)` (**new**) | as listed | a `TCanvas` (not yet saved) | builds the two-pad canvas, legend, χ²/ndof text, draws everything |
| `main(argv=None)` (**new**) | `argv` | `None` | orchestrates the above, then `canvas.SaveAs(output)` and closes the input file |
| `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` (**new**) | — | — | — |

**Step A — characterization (subprocess-level, since no functions exist
yet)**: run the current script as a subprocess against the already-
committed fixture
`run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`,
writing to a `tmp_path` output, and assert:
- the process exits 0;
- the output PDF is created and non-empty.

Do not attempt byte-identical PDF comparison — ROOT's PDF output is not
guaranteed bit-reproducible across environments/fonts, and Tier 1 already
established (2026-08-20 activity-log entry, "Plotting separated from
scientific acceptance") that PDF artifacts are excluded from strict
scientific comparison. The meaningful, stable invariant to characterize is
"runs successfully against a real fixture and produces a real, non-empty
plot" — record this explicitly as the chosen characterization strategy so
a future reader does not expect stronger guarantees than this step provides.

**Step B**:
- Introduce the six functions/guard in the table above, preserving every
  behavior Step A's subprocess-level test observed.
- Keep Step A's subprocess-level test (it becomes an end-to-end regression
  test of `main()`, still valuable after the split — do not delete it).
- **New tests required** (guardrail 4) for each newly-introduced function
  individually, using controlled ROOT test doubles per
  `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md`'s policy where full ROOT graphics aren't needed
  for the assertion (e.g. `parse_args()` needs no ROOT at all and should
  be tested with zero stubbing; `build_ratio_histogram()` can be tested
  against small real `ROOT.TH1D` fixture objects built in-test, without
  needing a full input file).
- Register `python/plotPostFit.py` and its new test file in
  `scripts/quality_check.py`.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_plot_post_fit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

---

### Chunk 11 — `plot_postfit.cpp`

**Current state**: one function, `plot_postfit(char const* in_dir, char
const* pars_str)`, invoked by the shell launchers as `root -l -q
"plot_postfit.cpp(\"$folder\", \"$pars\")"`. **This public entry point's
name and parameter order must not change** — the launcher calls it
positionally by that exact signature.

**No existing test harness for ROOT macros exists in this repository**
(Section 2) — Chunk 11 introduces the first one, kept consistent with the
rest of this plan's tooling: a small ROOT test macro, invoked via `root -l
-b -q` from a `pytest` wrapper (`subprocess.run([...])`), so it still
reports through the same `pytest`-based gates as everything else rather
than inventing a second, separate CI mechanism.

**Target decomposition**:

| New function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BumpHunterInfo read_bumphunter_results(std::string const& bh_log_name)` (**new** struct + function) | `bh_log_name: std::string` | `BumpHunterInfo { float global_pval, significance, mask_min, mask_max; bool available; }` | reads and regex-parses the file; `available=false` (not an exception) when the file is absent, matching current `bump_hunter = false` fallback |
| `PostfitHistograms load_postfit_histograms(TFile* native, TFile* masked, TFile* native_params, TFile* masked_params)` (**new** struct + function) | four `TFile*` (any may be null) | `PostfitHistograms` struct of the ten `TH1D*` fields currently declared inline | none beyond `Get<TH1D>` calls; preserves the current "exit(1) if native histograms missing" check — decide whether that check stays in the caller or moves into this function, record the decision |
| `void draw_residual_panel(TCanvas* can, TH1D* first, TH1D* second, bool bump_hunter, BumpHunterInfo const& bh, char const* pars_str, char const* out_file_name)` (**new**) | as listed | `void` | draws one panel and calls `can->Print(out_file_name)`; the existing loop over three histogram pairs calls this once per pair instead of repeating the body inline |
| `void plot_postfit(char const* in_dir, char const* pars_str)` (unchanged signature) | as today | `void` | becomes the orchestrator: build paths, open files, call the three functions above |

**Step A — characterization**: since there's no unit-callable structure yet,
characterize the **whole macro's current output** against the already-
committed J100 fixture directory
(`run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/`, which has no `BHresults.json`,
exercising the current no-BumpHunter fallback path):
- add a pytest wrapper (e.g. `tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py`) that runs
  `root -l -b -q 'plot_postfit.cpp("<fixture_dir>", "six")'` via
  `subprocess.run` into a `tmp_path` copy of the fixture directory (never
  write into the tracked fixture itself), and asserts: the process exits
  0; `post_fit.pdf` is created and non-empty in the output directory.
- this test is the C++-macro equivalent of Chunk 10's subprocess-level
  characterization, for the same reason (no pre-existing function
  boundary to characterize more precisely yet, and PDF bytes are not a
  meaningful comparison target per the same Tier 1 policy cited in Chunk
  10).

**Step B**:
- Introduce the `BumpHunterInfo`/`PostfitHistograms` structs and the three
  new free functions in the table above, rewriting `plot_postfit()` to
  call them, preserving every behavior Step A's macro-level test observed
  and preserving the public entry point's exact signature.
- Keep Step A's macro-level test (becomes an end-to-end regression test,
  still valuable — do not delete it).
- **New tests required** (guardrail 4) for the newly-introduced,
  independently-testable pieces — most importantly
  `read_bumphunter_results()`, since it needs no `TCanvas`/graphics at
  all: add a second ROOT test macro (e.g.
  `tests/root_macros/test_read_bumphunter_results.cpp`, invoked the same
  `root -l -b -q` way) that calls it against a small fixture
  `BHresults.json` (write one as a new, tracked test fixture — this
  repository's existing J100 canonical run has none, since it's
  unmasked) and asserts each `BumpHunterInfo` field against known values,
  plus a missing-file case asserting `available == false`.
  `load_postfit_histograms()` is harder to test in isolation without a
  real `TFile`, so cover it via the existing macro-level end-to-end test
  rather than inventing a synthetic ROOT-file-construction fixture just
  for this chunk — record this as a deliberate, explained scope boundary
  in `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` (Chunk 12), not a silent gap.
- No `scripts/quality_check.py` registration applies here (it only covers
  Python files); instead confirm `plot_postfit.cpp` still compiles/runs
  under `root -l -q` with no new external library linked, per guardrail
  11.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_plot_postfit_macro.py tests/test_read_bumphunter_results.py -v
```
(the second file is the thin Python/pytest wrapper invoking the new ROOT
test macro via `subprocess.run`, matching the wrapper pattern used for the
macro-level test)

---

### Chunk 12 — `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` and final documentation (single commit)

**Objective**: once Chunks 0–11 are all merged, write `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`,
modeled on the existing structure of `doc/TIER1_SYSTEM.md` and
`doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md` (purpose/audience/status, module map, test-file map,
gate commands, scope boundaries, known limitations). It must describe only
verified behavior — every claim cites the specific test function(s) or
gate run that proves it.

**Required contents at minimum**:
- the module tables from Sections 4.1 and 4.3, updated with the actual
  final function signatures where they were decided during Chunks 5, 9,
  10, 11 (the several "record the decision" points flagged in those
  chunks must all be resolved and documented here — this is where they
  land);
- the mapping from each module/file to its test file(s), including the
  two new ROOT-macro test files from Chunk 11;
- the unchanged Tier 1/2 gate commands, plus confirmation they still cover
  every extracted module;
- a "Known Limitations" section naming anything this plan deliberately
  left out of scope (Section 3), including the explicit
  `load_postfit_histograms()` (C++) testing gap noted in Chunk 11, so a
  future reader does not mistake an intentional boundary for an oversight.

**Acceptance check**: manual review — re-read the finished document
against the actual module and test files it describes, confirming every
claim has a citation. Then:
```bash
grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md   # must return nothing
git diff --check
```

---

## Chunks 13–18 (added 2026-09-04): the five hot-path support files

`doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` traced a real `scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`
run end to end and found five files that sit directly on that hot path
but were explicitly out of scope for Chunks 0–12: `python/PreFit.py`,
`python/ExtractFitParameters.py`, `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`,
`python/createBinning.py`, `python/FindBHWindow.py`. Chunks 13–18 below
bring these five into the same system, using Section 5's Step A/Step B
model unchanged — no new process, only new targets. There is no ordering
dependency between the five files themselves (each is reachable only
through a single, separate, already-Tier-3 caller module); they are
sequenced by ascending design risk: the file whose transform is a direct
structural clone of an already-executed Chunk 10 precedent first, the
file with zero existing test coverage of any kind last.

Two corrections to this plan's working assumptions, found by direct
verification while designing these chunks, recorded here so a later
reader does not have to rediscover them: `numpy` is **not** importable in
`.venv/bin/python` (affects Chunk 14's test design — see Section 4.5);
and `ExtractFitParameters.FitParameterExtractor`'s and
`ExtractPostfitFromWS.PostfitExtractor`'s shared `wsfile` constructor
parameter name is misleading — production (`run_fit.py:114–168`) passes
`wsfile=fitresultfile` to **both**, i.e. the quickFit *fit-result* file
(`FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`), never the XMLReader *workspace*
file (`dijetisrTLA_combWS_sixPar.root`) either class's parameter name
suggests. Chunk 15 records this as a Known Limitation rather than
renaming the parameter (renaming a public constructor argument on a class
still invoked by its own `main()` CLI wrapper is a behavior change beyond
what an extraction chunk authorizes).

---

### Chunk 13 — `python/createBinning.py`

**Target functions**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `parse_args(argv=None)` | `argv: list[str] \| None` | `argparse.Namespace` (`start`, `end`, `output`) | none |
| `load_resolution_fit(input_path="Input/data/dijetisrTLA/resolutionFits.root")` | `input_path: str` | a ROOT object exposing `.Eval(x)`, read from the key `"gsc_mjj_reso_fit"` (confirmed directly via `grep -n '\.Get(' python/createBinning.py` — the source's own literal, unchanged) | opens `input_path` via `ROOT.TFile.Open`; raises `OSError` if the file can't be opened, `KeyError` if the key is missing — both exactly as today |
| `resolve_bin_edges(reso_fit, rangelow, rangehigh)` | `reso_fit` (anything exposing `.Eval(x)`), `rangelow: int`, `rangehigh: int` | `list[float]` | none — pure computation once given an evaluable object |
| `build_binning_histogram(bin_edges)` | `bin_edges: list[float]` | a ROOT `TH1F` named `"mjjBinning"` | none |
| `main(argv=None)` (**new**, replaces the file's current top-to-bottom script body) | `argv` | `None` | writes `args.output` via the four functions above |

**Rationale**: this file has no functions at all today — it always
executes top-to-bottom on import or execution, the exact starting state
Chunk 10 found `python/plotPostFit.py` in. This chunk applies that same
transform: parse/validate/compute/write split into named functions plus
a `main()` and a **new** `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard this file
currently lacks. Preserve verbatim: the hardcoded input path (not
promoted to a new CLI flag — guardrail 11 forbids adding capability not
already present); the `from array import array` import's current
mid-script deferred placement (move it, do not promote it to top-level —
moving an existing deferred import into a new function is a
reorganization, not new code).

**Step A — characterization**: this repository commits no real
`Input/data/dijetisrTLA/resolutionFits.root` fixture at all (confirmed
directly — `find` over `Input/` and `run/` finds none), so Step A must
build a synthetic one, exactly reproducing the verification already
performed for this session's earlier syntax-bug fix
(`doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` Section 5): a trivial `TF1` at the real
key name the script's `.Get(...)` call reads. Since the input path is
hardcoded, not injectable, the test must write the synthetic fixture to
the real relative path, run the unmodified script as a subprocess, and
delete the synthetic file in a `finally` block — leaving nothing under
`Input/` changed, matching the manual verification's own care. Mark
`@pytest.mark.requires_root @pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies`,
reusing the sourced-`scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` subprocess pattern
already established in `tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`. Assert: exit 0; a
`TH1F` named `mjjBinning` with **38 bins spanning exactly `[481, 3000]`**
— the same result already observed once during the syntax-bug
verification, so this test both pins current behavior and cross-checks
that prior observation.

State plainly in this chunk's own activity-log entry: the standard
scientific gate (`test_authoritative_j100_j50_workflows_match_frozen_reference`)
never exercises this branch — both committed J100/J50 binning fixtures
already exist, so `if not os.path.exists(binningFileName):` is always
False in that gate. Running it here proves no regression to the
always-taken branch (the existence check itself), nothing about the
refactored script's own correctness — Step A's own subprocess test above
is the only real proof of that.

**Step B**:
- Create the four functions + `main()` + the new `__main__` guard in
  `python/createBinning.py`. `run_fit.py`'s call site
  (`execute(f"python3 python/createBinning.py -s {rangelow} -e {rangehigh} -o {binningFileName}")`)
  is unchanged by this chunk — its `execute()`-not-`execute_required()`
  unchecked-return-code behavior stays a separately-documented, unfixed
  finding (`doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md` Section 5), not touched here.
- Move Step A's test into `tests/test_create_binning.py` per the Test
  Relocation Rule.
- New tests (guardrail 4) for `parse_args()` and `resolve_bin_edges()`
  against a hand-written fake object exposing `.Eval()` — both need zero
  ROOT and become this file's first fast, unmarked tests.
- Register `python/createBinning.py` and `tests/test_create_binning.py`
  in `scripts/quality_check.py`'s `python_targets`/`test_targets`.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_create_binning.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" -v
```
The integration-gate run here is a no-regression check only, per the
coverage-gap caveat above — not proof of this chunk's own correctness.

### Chunk 14 — `python/FindBHWindow.py`

**Target functions**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `class NpEncoder(json.JSONEncoder)` | unchanged | unchanged | none |
| `parse_args(argv=None)` | `argv` | `argparse.Namespace` | none |
| `load_histograms(input_file)` | `input_file: str` | `(bkg_np, data_np)` — the `uproot` `.to_numpy()` results | opens `input_file` via `uproot` |
| `crop_data_to_background_range(data_edges, data_counts, bkg_edges)` | plain arrays/lists | cropped `(edges, counts)` | none — **numpy-only** once called with plain sequences, no `uproot`/`pyBumpHunter` needed |
| `run_bump_hunter(data_counts, data_edges, bkg_counts, bkg_edges)` | arrays | a scanned `pyBumpHunter.BumpHunter1D` instance | hardcoded scan params (`width_min=2, width_max=3, width_step=1, scan_step=1, npe=10000, nworker=1, seed=666`) preserved exactly, not promoted to CLI flags |
| `compute_mask_window(bump_hunter, use_bin_numbers)` | bump-hunter result state, `bool` | `dict{MaskMin, MaskMax, BlindRange}` | numpy-only; **the `use_bin_numbers=True`/`False` formulas stay two distinct branches**, not merged |
| `save_bump_plots(bump_hunter)` | — | `None` | writes hardcoded `bump.png`/`BH_statistics.png`, filenames preserved exactly |
| `write_mask_window_json(out_dict, outputjson)` | `dict`, `str` | `None` | `json.dump(..., cls=NpEncoder)` |
| `main(argv=None)` (existing, becomes the orchestrator) | `argv` | `None` | calls the above in sequence — **stays the sole, real entry point**: this file is always invoked as a whole subprocess under its own dedicated interpreter (`pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3`), never imported; this chunk must not change that CLI contract |

**Rationale**: mirrors Chunk 9's `plot_edm.py` parse/plot split — one
pure, cheaply-testable fragment (`crop_data_to_background_range`,
`compute_mask_window`) separated from the heavy-dependency I/O
surrounding it.

**Decision recorded during extraction** (mirroring Chunks 9–11's "Decisions
recorded during extraction" precedent, to be written up alongside Chunk
18): defer `matplotlib`, `uproot`, and `pyBumpHunter`'s currently
module-level imports into the one function each actually needs
(`save_bump_plots`, `load_histograms`, `run_bump_hunter` respectively),
keeping only `numpy`+stdlib at module scope. This is a reorganization of
existing import statements (guardrail 11), and it is what makes
`NpEncoder`/`parse_args`/`crop_data_to_background_range`/
`compute_mask_window` testable with only a `numpy` stub instead of four
heavy ones.

**Fixture, confirmed**: the already-committed
`run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/PostFit_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
does have both `Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned/postfit` and
`Run3TLA_rebinned/data` (confirmed directly by opening it and walking its
`TDirectory` structure) — `run_masking.py`'s hardcoded
`--bkghist`/`--datahist` flags resolve against it with no synthetic
fixture needed, same as Chunks 15/16.

**A related discovery, since resolved**: this repository briefly turned
out to also have real, committed masked-fit fixtures —
`run/fits/run_135_1000_sixPar/` and `run/fits/run_135_1000_sevenPar/`,
carrying `PostFit_*_masked.root`, `FitParameters_*_masked.root`, and a
real `BHresults.json`. Neither directory was produced by either current
launcher script (`rangelow=135` matches neither script's own value), and
no test referenced them. Per the repository's own analysis-output
tracking policy (outputs are not tracked unless needed for Tier 1/2
comparison, a documented Tier 1 output contract, or a real test fixture
loaded by path — none of which applied here), both directories were
removed from git tracking entirely (`git rm`, same day this was found) —
`doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`'s existing Known Limitations claim, "No masked-fit
fixture... exists in this repository," is accurate again as a result.
`FindBHWindow.py`'s masked path remains untested by any committed
fixture; Chunk 14's own text above already states plainly that this
chunk's dedicated-interpreter subprocess test is the only real proof of
its correctness, on the unmasked case.

**Step A — characterization**: nothing has moved yet, so simply importing
this file to characterize `NpEncoder` in isolation still needs stubs for
all four currently-module-level heavy imports. Write a minimal fake
`numpy` `ModuleType` exposing real, instantiable `integer`/`floating`/
`ndarray` classes (enough for `NpEncoder.default()`'s `isinstance`
checks) plus trivial empty fakes for `matplotlib`/`matplotlib.pyplot`/
`uproot`/`pyBumpHunter` — the same `ModuleType`-fake convention already
used for `ROOT`/`PreFit`/`ExtractPostfitFromWS`/`ExtractFitParameters`,
applied to a `numpy` module name for the first time in this plan.
Separately, characterize `main()`'s full real workflow via a subprocess
run against real `--bkghist`/`--datahist` inputs from the fixture
confirmed above, using the working ambient-interpreter combination found
below (not `pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3`, confirmed broken in this
environment - see "A further discovery" below).
The two new pure fragments (`crop_data_to_background_range`,
`compute_mask_window`) have no prior behavior to characterize — per
Chunks 4/5's own precedent for genuinely new logic, they get fresh tests
under guardrail 4 in Step B instead.

State plainly in this chunk's own activity-log entry, and record as a new
Known Limitations entry in Chunk 18: the standard scientific gate's
committed J100/J50 runs are unmasked (no `BHresults.json` in either
fixture directory), so it **never exercises this file's real behavior at
all** — running it here only proves `should_mask()`/`run_bumphunter()`
are still correctly not invoked on the unmasked path. The dedicated-
interpreter subprocess test above is the only real proof of this file's
own correctness, mirroring exactly how `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` already
documents `plot_postfit.cpp`'s untested masked-fit branch.

**Step B**:
- Extract the functions in the table above.
- Test Relocation Rule, **with an explicit, called-out exception**
  (no precedent for this yet in Chunks 0–12, so state it plainly rather
  than silently changing a stub list under cover of "import line only"):
  the relocated `NpEncoder` test drops three of its four Step A stubs,
  since only `numpy` remains module-level post-extraction.
- New tests: `parse_args()` (zero stub); `crop_data_to_background_range()`
  (numpy-stub or real numpy, plain-list inputs); `compute_mask_window()`
  as **two separate test functions**, one per `use_bin_numbers` branch,
  pinning both formulas independently so neither can later be silently
  unified; `write_mask_window_json()` exercising `NpEncoder` end to end.
- Register `python/FindBHWindow.py` and `tests/test_find_bh_window.py`.

**A further discovery, materially changing this chunk's real-proof
mechanism**: `pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env` — the dedicated interpreter
`run_masking.py` actually invokes in production — is itself broken in
this environment: its `pyvenv.cfg` sets
`include-system-site-packages = false`, and neither `uproot` nor
`matplotlib` was ever installed into its own `site-packages` (only the
`pyBumpHunter` package itself, as an egg). Confirmed directly:
`pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env/bin/python3 -c "import uproot"` fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError` before even reaching `pyBumpHunter`'s own import.
This means `run_masking.py`'s actual, real subprocess command cannot run
at all in this environment — a separate, pre-existing environment gap,
out of this chunk's scope to fix (matching `createBinning.py`'s own
missing-`resolutionFits.root` precedent), and **not** something this
chunk's extraction caused.

A working alternative was found and verified instead: the ambient
`python` that `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` already puts on `PATH`
(`/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_102a/.../bin/python`, the same one
`test_plot_post_fit.py`'s real-ROOT tests already use) has `numpy`,
`matplotlib`, and `uproot` all genuinely importable directly. It does
**not** have a genuine `pyBumpHunter` (importing it there resolves to
this repository's own top-level `pyBumpHunter/` submodule directory as
an empty namespace package — confirmed via `BH.__file__ is None` and
`hasattr(BH, "BumpHunter1D") is False`) **unless** the submodule's own
package directory, `pyBumpHunter/pyBumpHunter/`, is explicitly
**appended** to the existing `PYTHONPATH` (not replacing it — replacing
it was tried first and broke `matplotlib`, since the LCG view's own
setup already populates `PYTHONPATH` with entries `matplotlib`/`uproot`
resolve from). With that append, all four third-party dependencies
resolve correctly together, using only the ambient interpreter and the
already-vendored submodule — no new package installs, no production-code
change. Verified end to end against the real, already-committed J100
fixture: exit 0 in ~19 seconds real time, and — since `seed=666` is
fixed — a fully deterministic result across two separate runs
(`MaskMin=595.0`, `MaskMax=691.0`, `BlindRange="595,691"`).

This becomes the real acceptance-check mechanism for this chunk, in
place of the plan's original (broken) `pyBH_env` invocation:

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_find_bh_window.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" -v
# Real proof for this chunk (the gate above only confirms no regression

```

### Chunk 15 — `python/ExtractFitParameters.py`

**Target functions**: no new decomposition of `Extract()`, `WriteRoot()`,
or the 5 accessors is proposed — stated here explicitly, not silently
assumed uniform with the other four files.

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FitParameterExtractor.__init__(self, wsfile)` | `wsfile: str` | — | none (unchanged) |
| `Extract(self)` | — | populates `h1_params`/`h2_cov`/`h2_cor`/`nsig`/`nsigErr` | opens `wsfile`, reads the `fitResult` `RooFitResult` (unchanged) |
| `GetH1Params`/`GetH2Cov`/`GetH2Cor`/`GetNsig`/`GetNsigErr` | — | ROOT-typed values | lazily call `self.Extract()` if not yet run (unchanged) |
| `WriteRoot(self, outfile)` | `outfile: str` | — | writes the three histograms (unchanged) |

**Rationale, stated honestly**: `Extract()` (42 lines) is one cohesive
block — open file, build three histograms from one `RooFitResult`,
extract `nsig`/`nsigErr`. Forcing a 3-way split here would relocate, not
reduce, its complexity, unlike Chunk 16's genuinely tangled 137-line
`Extract()`. This chunk's entire value is the file's first-ever direct
test of its real behavior, plus registration.

**Step A — characterization**: read directly from `run_fit.py:168`
(`fpe = FitParameterExtractor(wsfile=fitresultfile)`) — production passes
the already-committed
`run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
directly as `wsfile`. Reuse it as-is; no synthetic fixture needed, the
lowest fixture-sourcing risk of all five chunks. Mark
`@pytest.mark.requires_root @pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies`,
same sourced-env subprocess-snippet pattern as
`tests/test_plot_post_fit.py`. Construct the real extractor, call
`.Extract()`, assert real, non-null values on all 5 accessors, and that
`.WriteRoot(tmp_path/"out.root")` produces a file whose three histograms
read back non-empty.

Add a dedicated, **fast** regression test (no real ROOT call needed) for
the `if not self.nsig:` falsiness quirk in `GetNsig`/`GetNsigErr`
(preserve, do not fix — a genuinely-zero `nsig` would currently re-trigger
`Extract()` every call): stub `sys.modules["ROOT"]` with a trivial empty
`ModuleType` (only needed so the module-level `import ROOT`/`from ROOT
import *` resolves), construct `FitParameterExtractor(wsfile="unused")`,
set `.nsig = 0.0` directly, monkeypatch `.Extract` with a call-counting
stub, call `.GetNsig()` twice, assert `Extract` fired both times;
contrast with `.nsig = 5.0`, where it must fire zero times.

**Step B**:
- No production-code restructuring beyond what Step A's tests require.
- Move Step A's tests into `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py`.
- Register `python/ExtractFitParameters.py` and
  `tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py`.
- Record in this chunk's activity-log entry, and again in Chunk 18's
  Known Limitations: `ExtractFitParameters.FitParameterExtractor`'s
  `wsfile` parameter and `ExtractPostfitFromWS.PostfitExtractor`'s
  same-named `wsfile` parameter mean the same thing in production (both
  receive the fit-result file, never the workspace file either name
  suggests) — documented, not renamed (Chunk 16's own header note above
  explains why a rename is out of scope).

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_extract_fit_parameters.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" -v
```

### Chunk 16 — `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`

**Target functions**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getNPars(pdf, obs, exclSyst)` | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged — **stays a free function** |
| `expHist(h)` | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged |
| `getChi2(extractor, channelname, npars, useSumW2=False)` | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged — **stays a free function that mutates the `extractor` instance passed to it directly**, not converted into a method; this coupling is preserved exactly, the same "preserve the quirk" principle already applied to `run_templates.py`'s `nPars` if/elif chain |
| `PostfitExtractor._open_workspace_and_data(self)` (**new**, private) | — | opened `wsfile`/`datafile` handles | ROOT file I/O |
| `PostfitExtractor._build_channel_postfit_histogram(self, ...)` (**new**, private) | per-channel state | a postfit `TH1` | preserves the `try/except: pass` `Scale()`-failure swallowing exactly (~current lines 223–227) — no logging, no re-raise added |
| `PostfitExtractor._build_bkgonly_variant(self, ...)` (**new**, private) | per-channel state | a bkg-only postfit `TH1` | same silent-swallow preservation (~current lines 259–263) |
| `PostfitExtractor._apply_external_rebinning(self, ...)` (**new**, private) | per-channel state, `rebinfile`/`rebinhist` | rebinned histograms | ROOT file I/O |
| `PostfitExtractor.Extract(self)` (existing, becomes the orchestrator) | — | as today | calls the four new private methods above plus `getChi2(self, ...)`, unchanged call shape |
| `WriteRoot()`, the 8 `Get*` accessors, `GetCategories()` | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged — **no decomposition**, already minimal one-liners |

**Rationale**: `Extract()` (137 lines) is the single largest method
across all nine files this plan (Chunks 0–18) touches — the primary
decomposition target. The three free functions and the accessors are
already minimal or intentionally-coupled (see above) and are left as-is.
The dead `import json` (confirmed via `grep -n 'json\.'
python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` finding no hits beyond the import line
itself) gets an **explicit, separately-noted removal** in this chunk's
Step B activity-log entry — not a silent drop bundled into the
extraction.

**Step A — characterization, including today's two dormant bugs,
pinned exactly as-is**: this file has no existing direct test of its own
real behavior (only a hand-written fake stands in for it in
`tests/test_run_fit.py`, testing `run_fit.py`'s caller logic, not this
file). Read directly from `run_fit.py:130–166` and
`scripts/run_anaFit_J100.sh`: reuse the already-committed
`run/fits/J100/run_481_3000_sixPar/FitResult_anaFit_sixPar_bkgOnly.root`
as `wsfile`, the committed J100 `datafile`/`datahist`, and the committed
`Input/data/dijetisrTLA/mjjResolutionBinning_481.root` as `rebinfile` —
no synthetic fixture needed. Mark
`@pytest.mark.requires_root @pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies`.
Construct a real extractor against these, call `.Extract()`, then call
every one of the 8 accessors **with no `channelname` argument** and
assert on **today's actual return value** for each — including the
**6** (`GetNbins`/`GetNpars`/`GetNdof`/`GetH1Chi2`/`GetH1Postfit`/
`GetH1Residuals`) that currently return a channel-name string instead of
the real histogram/int, because their fallback iterates
`next(iter(self.channel_X))` (dict keys) rather than
`next(iter(self.channel_X.values()))` like `GetChi2`/`GetPval` correctly
do. (Corrected during Chunk 16's own execution, verified by direct
source reading and a real run against the fixture below: this plan's
original design pass undercounted the affected accessors as 5, omitting
`GetNdof`, which has the identical `next(iter(self.channel_ndof))`
pattern — confirmed with `grep -n "GetNdof" python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`
and a real `.GetNdof()` call returning `'Run3TLA'` instead of `2513`.)
This is exactly Chunk 5's own precedent: pin the quirk down exactly
as-is so Step B cannot accidentally "clean it up." Also characterize
`getChi2()`'s external-mutation side effect directly: assert
`extractor.channel_chi2[channelname]` etc. are populated correctly
after a direct call.

**Step B**:
- Extract the four new private methods; `Extract()` becomes the
  orchestrator, calling them plus `getChi2(self, ...)` exactly as today.
- Remove the confirmed-dead `import json`, noted explicitly in the
  activity-log entry.
- Test Relocation Rule for the 8-accessor + `getChi2` characterization
  tests (including the two-buggy-and-preserved accessor assertions —
  these move with **no change to their assertions**, since Chunk 16 itself
  does not fix the bugs; see Chunks 16a/16b below for that).
- New tests for each new private helper (guardrail 4).
- Register `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` and
  `tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py`.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \

```

### Chunk 16a — (OPTIONAL) fix `WriteRoot(dirPerCategory=False)`'s Python-2-only dict indexing

Run only after Chunk 16 lands, against the newly-decomposed structure.
Never bundled into Chunk 16's own commit.

**Target**: `PostfitExtractor.WriteRoot(self, outfile, dirPerCategory=False)`'s
`dirPerCategory=False` branch, which currently does
`self.channel_hpostfit.values()[-1]` — Python-2-only dict-values
indexing, a real `TypeError` under Python 3. Currently dead-in-practice:
`run_fit.py` always calls `WriteRoot` with `dirPerCategory=True`
(`run_fit.py:165`), so this branch has never executed in the scientific
gate, in CI, or (as far as this repository's history shows) in any
verified run — the same dormancy pattern already verified once this
session for `createBinning.py`'s syntax error.

**Step A — characterization of the current bug**: a real-ROOT test
(reusing Chunk 16's fixture) that calls `WriteRoot(tmp_path/"out.root",
dirPerCategory=False)` and asserts it currently raises `TypeError` —
pinning the bug's existence before fixing it, exactly like this session's
`createBinning.py` fix confirmed the `IndentationError` first via
`ast.parse` before touching the file.

**Fix**: correct the Python-2 dict-values indexing to Python-3-correct
form (e.g. `list(self.channel_hpostfit.values())[-1]`, or an equivalent
that selects "the last channel's postfit histogram," matching the
existing variable's own documented intent — read the surrounding code
directly before choosing the exact replacement, do not guess a form that
changes *which* channel is selected).

**Step B**: replace Step A's `pytest.raises(TypeError)` assertion with an
assertion that `WriteRoot(dirPerCategory=False)` now succeeds and writes
the same *histogram content* the already-tested `dirPerCategory=True`
branch writes for the same input channel (both branches should select
the same "last" channel's data, just via different file-organization
strategies) — proving the fix, not just the absence of a crash. Register
no new files (this chunk only edits `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py` and
its already-registered test file).

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" -v
```
The gate above is a no-regression check: since `dirPerCategory=False` is
never reached from any production call site, this fix cannot change any
behavior the gate exercises.

---

### Chunk 16b — (OPTIONAL) fix the 6-of-8 accessors' key-vs-value fallback inconsistency

Run only after Chunk 16 (and, if done, 16a) lands. Never bundled into
Chunk 16's own commit.

**Target**: `GetNbins`/`GetNpars`/`GetNdof`/`GetH1Chi2`/`GetH1Postfit`/
`GetH1Residuals`'s no-`channelname` fallback currently does
`next(iter(self.channel_X))`, iterating dict **keys**, unlike
`GetChi2`/`GetPval` which correctly do
`next(iter(self.channel_X.values()))`. (Corrected during Chunk 16's own
execution: this list was originally undercounted as 5 accessors,
omitting `GetNdof` — confirmed by direct source reading and a real
`.GetNdof()` call against the fixture below, which returns `'Run3TLA'`
instead of the real ndof value.) Currently dead-in-practice:
`run_fit.py`'s only call site (`pfe.GetPval("Run3TLA_bkgonly_rebinned")`
/ `pfe.GetPval("Run3TLA_rebinned")`, `run_fit.py:160/162`) always supplies
`channelname` explicitly, so this fallback path is never exercised in
production.

**Step A**: Chunk 16's own Step A already characterized and pinned this
exact wrong-type-return behavior (its 8-accessor no-`channelname` test) —
reuse those six assertions as this chunk's characterization; no new
characterization test is needed beyond confirming they still pass
unmodified immediately before this chunk's fix.

**Fix**: change the 6 affected methods' fallback from
`next(iter(self.channel_X))` to `next(iter(self.channel_X.values()))`,
matching `GetChi2`/`GetPval`'s already-correct pattern exactly.

**Step B**: update the 6 reused assertions from "returns a channel-name
string" to "returns the real histogram/int value," and add one assertion
per accessor confirming the returned value now matches what an explicit
`channelname` call returns for the same (single-channel) fixture — proving
all 8 accessors are now behaviorally consistent. State explicitly in the
activity-log entry, as the safety argument for fixing this post-hoc
rather than leaving it per Chunk 16's own "preserve, don't fix" default:
since the only production call site always passes `channelname`
explicitly, this fix cannot change any behavior the scientific gate (or
any other currently-passing test) exercises.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_extract_postfit_from_ws.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" -v

### Chunk 17 — `python/PreFit.py`

**Target functions**:

| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PreFitter.__init__` | unchanged | — | unchanged |
| `RandomizeParameters(self, function)` | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged |
| `_build_candidate_functions(self, ...)` (**new**, private) | current histogram-range/log-mode state | the 10 hardcoded `TF1` candidates (`NParFunction[1..10]`, `LogNParFunction[1..10]`) | none beyond `TF1` construction — values unchanged |
| `_select_best_parameter_sets(self, ...)` (**new**, private) | candidate functions, `nRetries1`, `nRetries2` | the ranked best-`nRetries2` parameter sets by chi2 | isolates the array/bisect bookkeeping (current ~lines 127–132); no ROOT calls of its own beyond scoring the candidates it's handed |
| `Fit(self)` (existing, becomes the orchestrator) | — | `(bestPars, nbkg)`, unchanged | reads/log-transforms the data histogram, calls the two new helpers above, refits the survivors with `TH1::Fit` |
| `main(args)` | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged — still unused from the pipeline |

**Rationale**: `PreFitter.Fit()` (130 lines) is this file's only large
method, and this file has **zero existing test coverage of its own real
behavior anywhere** — the only existing test
(`tests/test_run_templates.py::_install_fake_prefitter`) fakes the whole
class to test `run_templates.py`'s caller logic instead. `_select_best_parameter_sets`
is the one piece of this file that becomes independently testable once
separated from the ROOT calls surrounding it.

**Latent fragility documented, not fixed**: `parRangeLow`/`parRangeHigh`
default to 7-element lists while `nPars` can be requested up to 10 —
callers must supply longer lists themselves (as `run_templates.py`
already does). Add a regression test asserting today's `IndexError`
for `nPars > 7` under the default ranges, characterizing the risk rather
than closing it.

**Step A — characterization**: use the real, committed J100 `datafile`/
`datahist` with `xMin=481, xMax=3000` — real data, real ROOT `TH1::Fit`,
real `seed=42` determinism — but **deliberately scale down**
`nPars`/`nRetries1`/`nRetries2` (e.g. `nPars=3, nRetries1=50,
nRetries2=3`) purely for test speed, stated explicitly as a
characterization-strategy choice (real data and fit machinery, reduced
scale), distinct from Chunk 13's need for a wholly synthetic fixture.
Mark `@pytest.mark.requires_root @pytest.mark.requires_analysis_dependencies`.
Assert on the `(bestPars, nbkg)` return shape and that two runs with the
same `seed=42` reproduce the same result (a determinism check, not a
physics-correctness check).

**Step B**:
- Extract `_build_candidate_functions`/`_select_best_parameter_sets`;
  `Fit()` becomes the orchestrator.
- Test Relocation Rule for Step A's test.
- New tests: `_build_candidate_functions()` (assert the 20 `TF1`s are
  built with the documented names/forms) and
  `_select_best_parameter_sets()` written, if its signature allows,
  against a plain scoring callable + candidate list rather than a live
  ROOT histogram — this repository's first stub-free, fast unit test of
  any piece of `PreFit.py`'s own logic, if achievable; if the separation
  cannot be made ROOT-free without changing `Fit()`'s external behavior,
  state that explicitly rather than forcing it.
- Register `python/PreFit.py` and `tests/test_pre_fit.py`.

**Acceptance check**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_pre_fit.py -v
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" -v
```

### Chunk 18 — Documentation update for the extended scope (single commit)

**Objective**: once Chunks 13–17 (and, if done, 16a/16b) are merged,
revise the three documents this extension touches so none of them still
claims a narrower or "finished" scope than the repository actually has.

**Required contents at minimum**:
- `doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` (this document): confirm Section 0/3's
  extended-scope language (already added alongside Chunks 13–17
  themselves) matches the final, as-implemented state; extend Section 9's
  completion definition to "Chunks 0 through 18" plus new bullets for the
  five files' final decomposition/test/registration state, including the
  explicit caveat that the standard scientific gate does not prove
  `FindBHWindow.py`'s (Chunk 14) or fully `createBinning.py`'s (Chunk 13)
  correctness — name the gates that do instead; update Section 10's "four
  named in Section 0" to "nine."
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md`: add a new, dated note **superseding, not
  silently rewriting**, the existing "all twelve chunks are complete"
  status line (matching the activity log's own append-only spirit even in
  a document without that formal rule) — the original line stays, dated,
  describing Chunks 0–12 as they stood at Chunk 12's own commit; a new
  paragraph states Chunks 13–18 extended the system on 2026-09-04. Add a
  new "Module map: hot-path support scripts" table (5 rows, matching the
  existing two module-map tables' format) and 5 new test-file-map rows.
  New Known Limitations entries: the `ExtractPostfitFromWS` bugs' final
  status (fixed, if 16a/16b landed, or preserved-and-documented if not);
  `FindBHWindow.py`'s masked-path gate-coverage gap, mirroring the
  existing `plot_postfit.cpp` entry; the `wsfile` double-meaning across
  the two extractor classes; `PreFit.py`'s 7-vs-10-element fragility;
  `createBinning.py`'s still-unchecked `execute()` return code (unfixed,
  cross-referenced to `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`); the new
  `numpy`-stub testing technique and why it was needed. Add the new
  `FindBHWindow.py` dedicated-interpreter gate command. Extend
  "Authoritative files" and "Completion definition."
- `doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md`: move the five files from Section 3's
  "does NOT follow the Tier 3 system" table into Section 2's "ARE part
  of"; remove the `(*)` markers from Section 1's call-graph diagram for
  all five and update the legend; revise the sentence declaring this a
  boundary "not something this document is proposing to change" — it has
  now changed.

**Acceptance check**: manual review — re-read all three documents against
the actual, final state of the five files and their tests, confirming
every claim has a citation, no stale "four files"/"Chunks 0–12 only"
claim survives unedited outside of a clearly-dated historical reference.
Then:
```bash
grep -nE '[[:blank:]]+$' doc/TIER3_COMPLETION_PLAN.md doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md doc/TIER3_EXECUTION_TRACE.md
git diff --check
```

## 7. Gates to run

Use exactly these commands. Do not invent alternative invocations.

```bash
# After every step's focused tests
python -m pytest <this chunk's test file(s)> tests/test_run_anaFit.py -v

# After every coherent commit
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full

# Mandatory in Chunks 4, 5, and 8 specifically (any step that touches a
# real branch condition or template-generation logic, not just moves an
# already-isolated pure function) — and always before Chunk 12
python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_workflows_integration.py \
  -m "integration and requires_root" -v

# After any chunk touching dependency-facing code paths, if in doubt
python -m pytest tests/test_repo_utils.py -m "requires_analysis_dependencies" -v

# Chunk 14 only — the standard scientific gate above never exercises
# FindBHWindow.py's real behavior (both committed J100/J50 fixtures are
# unmasked); this subprocess run is the only real proof of that chunk's
# own correctness. Uses the working ambient-interpreter + PYTHONPATH
# combination Chunk 14 found (pyBumpHunter/pyBH_env is confirmed broken
# in this environment - missing uproot and matplotlib in its own
# site-packages), not the broken dedicated venv this repository's
# production code still invokes unchanged.
repo_dir="$PWD"
source scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh
export PYTHONPATH="$repo_dir/pyBumpHunter:$PYTHONPATH"
python3 python/FindBHWindow.py \
  --inputfile <a real PostFit_*.root> \
  --bkghist Run3TLA_rebinned/postfit --datahist Run3TLA_rebinned/data \
  --outputjson <tmp path>

# Before any commit is marked ready
git status -sb
git diff --check
git diff --stat
```

Record every exit code in the commit's activity-log entry. A step's
commit is not ready if any required gate above was skipped or failed.

---

## 8. Per-step compliance checklist

Two variants — use whichever matches the step whose commit is about to be
made. Run this against **this document** before making that commit (for
Step A) or before opening the eventual PR for review (as a final check
covering every commit in it). If any answer is "no," the commit/PR is not
ready.

**Step A (characterization) checklist**:
```text
1. Which chunk does this commit belong to, and is it Step A? (name it explicitly)
2. Does `git diff --stat` show ONLY new test file(s) — zero production files touched?
3. Does every new/confirmed test assert a real input/output/side-effect,
   not merely "does not raise"?
4. Were the tests run (or a real trace of them reviewed) by a human,
   against the unmodified target file, not only reported as passing by
   the author?
5. Was explicit human-verification confirmation given, in session, before
   Step B's commit was made — and is that recorded in Step B's
   activity-log entry?
6. Were only the explicit, intended files staged (no `git add .`)?
7. Has a new dated section been appended to doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md (not a
   rewrite of any existing section)?
```

**Step B (extraction) checklist**:
```text
1. Which chunk does this commit belong to, and is it Step B? (name it explicitly)
2. Did Step A's commit for this chunk precede this one in the branch
   history, and is it named/linked in this commit's activity-log entry?
3. Does the change avoid touching scientific constants, references,
   tolerances, dependency revisions, or canonical workflow arguments?
4. Is every relocated test's diff limited to its import line — assertions
   and fixture setup unchanged?
5. Is every newly-introduced function (not merely moved) covered by a new
   focused test (success path + at least one failure/invalid path, where
   applicable)?
6. Does the production code actually call the new/moved function (grep
   for it — do not assume)?
7. Were only the explicit, intended files staged (no `git add .`)?
8. Did the relevant gates in Section 7 run and pass, with output captured?
9. Does `git diff --check` pass over the full range of the change?
10. Has a new dated section been appended to doc/ACTIVITY_LOG.md?
11. Does the activity-log entry name which chunk is now resolved, and
    leave unresolved chunks explicitly listed as still open?
12. Did this commit avoid consulting or reusing any other branch's Tier 3 work?
```

---

## 9. Completion definition for this plan

Tier 3 is complete only when:

- Every chunk in Section 6 (0 through 18, including any of the optional
  16a/16b that were undertaken) has both its steps' commits (or single
  commit, for Chunks 0, 8, 12, 18) made, each with a corresponding
  activity-log entry recording passing gate output.
- `run_anaFit.py` contains only `run_anaFit()`, `main()`, and the
  `__main__` guard (Chunk 8's acceptance check).
- No extracted Python module imports from `run_anaFit.py`.
- `plot_edm.py`, `python/plotPostFit.py`, and `plot_postfit.cpp` each
  match their Section 4.3 target decomposition, with `plot_postfit.cpp`'s
  public `plot_postfit(char const*, char const*)` entry point unchanged.
- **(Added 2026-09-04)** `python/createBinning.py`, `python/FindBHWindow.py`,
  `python/ExtractFitParameters.py`, `python/ExtractPostfitFromWS.py`, and
  `python/PreFit.py` each match their Section 4.4 target decomposition,
  each is registered in `scripts/quality_check.py`, and each has a
  dedicated test file exercising its own real behavior directly (not only
  through a caller-side fake).
- `git diff --check` passes with zero errors over the full Tier 3 change
  range.
- No untracked repository-root artifacts remain from test execution.
- `doc/TIER3_SYSTEM.md` exists and describes only verified behavior, with
  every claim backed by a named passing test or gate.
- All gates in Section 7 pass on the final commit, with exit codes
  recorded in the activity log — **except** that the standard scientific
  gate's pass does not by itself prove `python/FindBHWindow.py`'s or
  fully `python/createBinning.py`'s own correctness (Chunks 13/14's own
  text); those two additionally require their own dedicated-interpreter/
  subprocess gate results recorded, per Section 7.
- The frozen J100/J50 references, tolerances, and canonical scientific
  configuration in `tests/references/analysis_reference.json` are
  unchanged from their values at the start of this plan (Section 2).

Do not declare Tier 3 complete in any document unless every bullet above
is independently verifiable from the activity log and the repository's
commit history at the time the claim is made.

## 10. Scope boundary

Nothing in this plan authorizes CLs implementation, signal-analysis
changes, new physics models, new canonical inputs, changed fit ranges or
tolerances, Tier 4 orchestration, repository-wide style cleanup, or
decomposition of any file beyond the nine named across Section 0 and the
Chunk 13–18 addition (Section 3). It also does not authorize consulting,
merging in, or reproducing any other branch's independent Tier 3 work —
this plan is meant to stand on its own. Any proposal to cross these
boundaries requires a separate plan and explicit review.
