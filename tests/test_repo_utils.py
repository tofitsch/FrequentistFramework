    A heredoc body is data, not commands: `cat <<EOF` followed by a
    gate's own pytest command prints that command and runs nothing.
    Every spelling was measured - `<<EOF`, `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`,
    `<<-EOF`, a heredoc redirected into a file, and one inside a
    workflow `run:` block.

    These are one pass because the order they are applied in is itself
    a correctness question, and applying them separately got it wrong
    twice:

    - a full-line comment has to go *before* heredoc openers are looked
      for, or `# cat <<EOF` starts a heredoc and hides the rest of the
      file;
    - a body line has to be compared against its *raw* text, because
      bash ends a body only at a line that is exactly the delimiter.
      Measured: an indented `  EOF` does not end a `<<EOF` body, nor
      does `EOF ` with a trailing space, and `<<-EOF` accepts leading
      tabs but not leading spaces. So stripping a trailing comment
      first would turn `EOF # done` into a terminator the shell does
      not see;
    - and the body has to be found before continuations are joined,
      because joining strips the indentation that exact match needs.
      The previous order joined first and compared `line.strip()`, so
      an indented copy of the delimiter inside a body ended it early
      and every line after it - a real pytest command among them - was
      read back as a command the file runs.

    Heredoc removal started in `_executable_command_lines()` alone,
    which left `_pytest_command_lines()` without it: all six spellings

    configuration says something else - the same false-positive class as
    the command searches above.

    The shell inside a `run:` block is the third such position, and it
    is the mirror image of the finding that produced
    `_workflow_run_block_lines()`: that one was a step `name:` read as
    a command, this one is a command read as configuration. Confirmed

    are measured against PyYAML 6.0.3, because they fold differently
    and the difference decides whether a line is a command of its own.

    A folded block is not one command per line. YAML joins consecutive
    non-empty lines with a single space and only a blank line becomes a
    newline, so

        run: >
          echo "about to run"
          python -m pytest tests/test_x.py

    reaches bash as a single `echo` whose arguments happen to include
    the word pytest, and runs no tests at all. Read line by line it
    looked like an echo that gets dropped followed by a real pytest
    invocation - the exact "text that is only printed read as a command
    that runs" false positive these readers exist to prevent, arriving
    by a new route. Confirmed against PyYAML 6.0.3 for the folded, the
    literal and the plain (no indicator) spellings.

    Folding stops at a more-indented line in a `>` block: YAML keeps
    such a line, and the breaks on either side of it, exactly as
    written, so

        run: >
          echo "about to run"

    really does run the tests, on its own line, while the paragraph
    rule alone joined it into the echo and reported a workflow that
    runs no tests. Measured: PyYAML returns
    `'echo "about to run"\\n  python -m pytest tests/test_x.py\\n'`
    here.

    A plain scalar folds the same two lines into one, because its
    folding ignores indentation entirely - the same text is one command
    after a bare `run:` and two after a `run: >`. That is why the style
    is carried here rather than a single "folded" flag: the flag made
    the plain spelling report a pytest invocation the shell never
    receives, which is the loud direction of the same error.

    A command inside a function that nothing calls never runs, while
    its text sits in the file exactly as if it did. Confirmed by
    sabotage: moving the whole plotting gate into a `never_called() {
    ... }` wrapper is valid shell, runs nothing, leaves `failures` at
    zero so the script reports "All gates passed", and left both
    coverage tests passing.

    For a gate command the rule is that it has to sit at top level,
    which the real gate sources satisfy: `run_gate` is a function, but
    every pytest command is passed to it as an *argument* from top
    level, not written inside its body. `only_uncalled=True` asks the
    weaker question instead - is this function called anywhere at all -
    which is what the installer checks need, and why the two are one
    function with a flag rather than two scans. See
    `_function_definition_spans()` for the measurement behind that
    split.

    Every form bash accepts is recognised, not just the one this rule
    was first written against: the `function name` keyword form, a
    hyphenated name, a parenthesis body, and a body whose opening
    brace sits on the following line. Depth is counted by
    `_body_depth_change()`, so a brace that is not a delimiter cannot
    end a body early and expose the rest of it as top-level text.

    The span covers the definition line and the whole body, so a caller
    can drop either every function body or only the bodies of functions
    whose name is never used as a word anywhere outside their own span.

    That second option exists because the two readers need different
    rules, and measuring said so. Every pytest command in every gate
    source sits at top level, so requiring that of a gate command costs
    nothing and is the stronger rule. `install.sh` and
    `install_pyBumpHunter.sh` are the opposite: nearly every command
    they run is inside a function - `require_file`, `verify_dependency`,
    `build_cpp_dependency` - so the same rule would have dropped over a
    hundred real commands from the installer view and broken the
    assertions that check what those installers do.

    Deciding whether a function is *reachable* is a call-graph problem
    this deliberately does not solve: a name used outside its own span
    counts as called, even if the only use is inside another function
    that nothing calls. That is an over-approximation, so it errs
    towards keeping a body rather than hiding one.

    `test_documented_gate_figures_agree_across_every_living_document`
    compares the documents against each other, so it cannot catch a
    figure that is stale in every copy at once - and for the
    prepared-dependency gate there is only one copy, so it catches
    nothing there at all. That is not hypothetical: its deselected count
    sat at 19 after two tests were added to `tests/test_repo_utils.py`,
    and no check noticed. Collection is deterministic and needs no ROOT,
    so for these two gates the documented counts can simply be measured.

    74.68s, 131.40s and 134.41s on this shared node for identical work,
