## Install

This program runs on Unix systems.

```bash
setupATLAS
lsetup git
git clone https://github.com/tofitsch/FrequentistFramework --branch harry
cd FrequentistFramework
bash install.sh --build
```

Do not run the installer with `. install.sh` or `source install.sh`. The installer uses `exit` to report failures, which would terminate the active shell session if it were sourced.

Change `out_dir` at the start of `scripts/run_anaFit.sh` to select where the analysis results will be stored.

## Setup

```bash
. setup.sh
```

## Run

```bash
. scripts/run_anaFit.sh
```

## Files

The 100% unblinding file is:

```text
data/data23_histos.root
```

It is from the [full-unblinding histogram outputs](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tla-atlas-run3/tla-ntuple-analysis/-/tree/full-unblinding/outputs/FINAL_100pc_unblinding_histograms?ref_type=heads).

## Tier 1 and Tier 2 validation

Tier 1 provides the scientific safety system for the authoritative J100 and J50 background-only workflows. It protects the launcher contracts, required scientific artifacts, schema-version-2 provenance, fit parameters, and chi-square p-values.

Tier 2 provides the reproducible Python development environment and the lightweight pytest, Ruff, and Black quality gate.

Create and activate the development environment with:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev-lock.txt
```

Run the complete lightweight Tier 1 and Tier 2 quality gate with:

```bash
python scripts/quality_check.py --mode full
```

This command runs the approved lightweight pytest suite and the configured Ruff and Black checks. Scientific tests that require ROOT and the prepared analysis dependencies are separate from the lightweight gate.

### Mandatory pre-commit gate

Install a local git hook that runs the same lightweight quality gate as CI, plus the ROOT-dependent J100/J50 scientific integration gate whenever `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` can actually provide a ROOT runtime here (skipped with a warning otherwise, not blocked):

```bash
bash scripts/install_git_hooks.sh
```

This is a plain git-native hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`), not the third-party `pre-commit` framework — see [Tier 2 system](doc/TIER2_SYSTEM.md) for why that framework stays optional. Bypass for a single commit with `git commit --no-verify` if you must, but a bypassed commit still has to pass both gates in CI.

### Run every gate in one command

```bash
bash scripts/run_all_gates.sh
```

Runs five gates in one command: the lightweight gate, the prepared external-dependency checks, the scientific runtime-readiness gate, the real J100/J50 scientific analysis, and every plotting-layer/hot-path-support test that needs a real ROOT runtime — the same five test gates `.github/workflows/scientific-analysis.yml` runs (that workflow additionally runs dependency build/check steps this script does not). The first two need no ROOT and always run. The other three require `scripts/setup_buildAndFit.sh` to actually provide a ROOT runtime here (CVMFS mounted); unlike the pre-commit hook above, the script fails loudly rather than skipping when that isn't available, since its whole purpose is to run everything.
